    "title": "EV startup Polestar braces for two product launches in less than a year",
    "content": "CEO Thomas Ingenlath attends a celebration this week for the Polestar 3 in Los Angeles.\nLOS ANGELES — Electric vehicle maker Polestar is witnessing the downside of the \"asset-light\" strategy that is key to its rapid growth plan.\nTo operate fast and easy, Polestar is reliant on global partners to help produce its models. But when those partners can't deliver according to plan, Polestar's strategy can kneecap its growth.\nThat is what is happening to the Swedish startup.\nPolestar is part of a portfolio of brands controlled by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, which includes Volvo Cars, Lynk & Co and Lotus. The Chinese conglomerate's network of global factories, supplier networks and R&D centers allow the young brand to focus on product and technology rather than manufacturing or logistics, according to the plan.\n \nBut software-related hiccups in the development of Volvo's new SPA2 vehicle platform could complicate Polestar's ambitions to expand in the U.S. market.\nThe Polestar 3 midsize crossover, based on the SPA2 architecture, has been delayed by nearly a year, causing a cascading effect on Polestar's commercial strategy. The fledgling brand suddenly finds itself juggling back-to-back product rollouts.\nThe Polestar 3 is now expected in U.S. stores in the fourth quarter, and only about nine months later comes the coupe-style Polestar 4 crossover.\n\"When everybody is scared of one launch, how can we launch two cars from an industrial point of view?\" wondered CEO Thomas Ingenlath in an interview with Automotive News on the sidelines of a Polestar 3 event here.\n \nScaling fast\nPolestar's predicament illustrates the downside of reliance on others for product development and manufacturing.\nThe delay of Polestar's first crossover and a critical U.S. model is hurting its retailers' bottom lines.\nWith just one model to sell, dealers say they don't have throughput to justify their investment in high-rent shopping center stores.\n\"A year earlier or later makes a difference in the marketplace where competitors are developing cars,\" said Ingenlath, a lanky German designer with a penchant for tailored suits and turtlenecks.\nWhile Polestar can't fully control its destiny with the collaborative model, Ingenlath said it's still a more pragmatic approach for rapidly scaling up. By about mid-decade, Polestar will flesh out its model lineup with crossovers, a large sedan and a roadster.\n\"We would be in a completely different situation,\" Ingenlath said, if Polestar had instead decided to build its cars from scratch.\nThe CEO points to Tesla, the only automotive startup in recent history to achieve market scale, as an example of how long the go-it-alone strategy would take Polestar.\n\"Tesla has been doing this now for over a decade,\" Ingenlath said. \"That definitely takes a long, long time.\"\nRelated Article\nPolestar leasing gets a lift from new U.S. EV tax credit\nMultiple launches\nThe back-to-back launches that are coming will undoubtedly strain Polestar's marketing and commercial teams, but Ingenlath does not expect much sales cannibalization. The two models \"are very different in what they represent and what they do,\" he said.\nHe described the Porsche Cayenne-size, high-riding Polestar 3 as more of a \"true SUV.\"\nIn contrast, the sportier Polestar 4 is more of a \"four-door GT but with a little bit elevated position.\"\nModel pricing will also create differentiation.\nThe Polestar 3, starting at $85,300 including shipping, aims at the upper end of the premium crossover segment, while the Polestar 4 is more affordable luxury.\n\"A car from $60,000 reaches a completely different target audience than a car in the $80,000 range,\" Ingenath said.\nCharleston-made\nPolestar's crossovers will be built at Volvo and Geely plants.\nThe Polestar 3 will be the brand's first U.S.-built model, with production at Volvo's 2.3-million-square-foot factory, an hour northwest of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\"Charleston is super important\" for Polestar's ambitions in the U.S., Ingenlath said. The assembly plant will supply the global output of Polestar 3, except for China.\nDomestic production is good from an economic point of view but also psychologically, Ingenlath said.\n\"It's such a strong signal for the U.S. market that we come here and produce a car that we sell here — and export the car from the U.S.,\" he said.\nDue to its sticker price, the dual-motor Polestar 3 will not initially qualify for federal EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act despite domestic production. But a new single-motor variant that should arrive in the second half of 2024 will be priced below the $80,000 threshold to claim the federal tax incentives of up to $7,500.\nRelated Article\nPolestar to drop $20 million in Q2 to market its first crossover\nWeighing options\nThe Polestar 4, based on Geely's SEA platform, faces a hefty 27.5 percent U.S. tariff levied on Chinese imports, putting a wrinkle in the model's mass-market aspirations.\nIngenlath said the company is \"evaluating\" manufacturing options outside China.\nThe Geely group's global production network is \"something we can leverage,\" the CEO said. \"If there is an attractive and economically feasible solution, we will consider bringing [Polestar 4 production] somewhere else.\"\nBut locating Polestar 4 production stateside is unlikely because Geely would need a factory and supplier network here.\nIngenlath said it is \"impossible\" to build every model in the portfolio in every region in which they sell.\nThe Polestar 4 could also benefit from a U.S. trade agreement that allows the automaker to offset import tariffs with the export of U.S.-made models.\n\"The cars that we produce that we export help us to import the cars that we don't produce here,\" Ingenlath said.",

    "content": "NEW YORK, March  27, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO), and Cognyte Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CGNT). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT)  Class Period: August 30, 2021 - October 31, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 25, 2023  This case is about the rise and fall of a company that initially benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic (also referred to herein as “COVID-19,” “COVID,” or the “pandemic”). As a vaccine manufacturer, Catalent was one of the beneficiaries of COVID because it seemed well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for vaccine production capacity. Indeed, Catalent almost doubled its business during the first year of the pandemic when the bulk of vaccines were administered. Catalent’s success during the early stages of the pandemic caused its stock price to soar to record highs. By mid-2021, when COVID-related work dropped off, Defendants engaged in accounting and channel stuffing schemes to pad the Company’s revenues. These schemes gave Catalent the appearance of continued growth, causing its stock price to reach new record highs. Meanwhile, to support these schemes and keep pace with its lofty growth targets, Catalent was cutting corners on safety and control procedures at key production facilities. By late 2022, Catalent reported significant sales declines and excess inventory throughout its supply chain. As a result, Catalent stock dropped to pre-COVID levels causing substantial losses to its investors as they learned that Catalent’s early-COVID revenues were never sustainable, and its Class Period revenues were the product of securities fraud.  By way of background, Catalent is a multinational corporation that manufactures and packages drugs into delivery devices fit for human consumption (i.e., pre-filled syringes, vials, pills, etc.) pursuant to long-term supply contracts with pharmaceutical companies. Catalent directly sells these products to pharmaceutical companies which later sell them through the supply chain to healthcare providers (i.e., hospitals, clinics, etc.), which administer them to patients, who are the end consumers.   Prior to the onset of the pandemic, Catalent’s quarterly revenue averaged approximately $669 million between April 2018 and March 2020. During the period that those revenues were reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of approximately $47.57 per share. In early 2020, Catalent took on numerous large-scale COVID projects, including filling vaccines into syringes for Moderna and AstraZeneca. Those projects catapulted the Company’s quarterly revenues to record highs, which averaged approximately $940 million between April 2020 and March 2021, a 40 percent jump over preCOVID revenues. Over the period when that revenue surge was reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of $102.42 per share.  By mid-2021, as the pandemic wore on, demand for Catalent’s COVID products decreased because vaccinations had already been administered to a large number of potential patients. For example, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) data indicates that COVID vaccinations in the United States reached an all-time high of 4.5 million doses on April 1, 2021, and averaged 1.5 million daily doses between December 14, 2020 and August 28, 2021. By comparison, CDC data indicates that average daily vaccinations in the United States were under 625,000 during the Class Period.  Despite this marked decline in the demand for COVID vaccines, Catalent continued to report growing revenues and assured investors that customer demand remained strong during the Class Period. The average quarterly revenue reported during the Class Period was $1.2 billion, an 80 percent increase over preCOVID-19 revenues and a 28 percent increase over its reported revenues for the first year of the pandemic. Unbeknownst to investors, Defendants artificially inflated these revenues through fraudulent accounting and channel stuffing schemes to mislead investors into believing that Catalent was generating sustainable revenue growth. Defendants’ fraud caused Catalent stock to trade at a record high of $142.64 per share on September 9, 2021 and an average closing price of approximately $108.00 per share during the Class Period.  Statements made by Defendants throughout the Class Period were materially false and misleading when made because they misrepresented or failed to disclose the following adverse facts, which were known to Defendants or recklessly disregarded by them:  a. Catalent materially overstated its revenue and earnings by prematurely recognizing revenue in violation of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”);  b. Catalent had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to revenue recognition;  c. Catalent falsely represented demand for its products while it knowingly sold more product to its direct customers than could be sold to healthcare providers and end consumers;  d. Catalent disregarded regulatory rules at key production facilities in order to rapidly produce excess inventory that was used to pad the Company’s financial results through premature revenue recognition in violation of GAAP and/or stuffing its direct customers with this excess inventory; and  e. As a result of the foregoing, Defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company’s financial performance, outlook, and regulatory compliance during the Class Period.  Catalent’s misrepresentations were first revealed to the market on August 29, 2022, when the Company disclosed that demand for its COVID-related products was facing substantial headwinds. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 7.4 percent to close at $92.28 per share on August 29, 2022.  Then, on September 20, 2022, a Washington Post report exposed that the release of COVID-19 vaccines produced by Catalent had been delayed by regulators because of improper sterilization at one of Catalent’s key facilities. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 9.3 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $79.06 per share on September 22, 2022.  On November 1, 2022, Catalent revealed that its quarterly earnings had declined to zero and lowered its financial guidance, indicating falling demand. The Company also disclosed that regulatory issues at its key facilities were negatively impacting its financial results. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 31.7 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $44.90 per share on November 2, 2022. All told, over the course of the Class period, Catalent stock fell from a high above $142.00 to close at $44.90 on November 2, 2022, a more than 68 percent decline.  On November 16, 2022, Catalent revealed that it was carrying approximately $400 million in excess inventory, further revealing that the Company had misrepresented demand for its products as well as its purported ability to predict future demand. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 8.5 percent, over two trading sessions, to close at $42.07 per share on November 17, 2022.  Then, on December 8, 2022, GlassHouse Research published a report claiming that Catalent had been materially overstating its revenues by $568.2 million in violation of GAAP. The report detailed numerous red flags that were indicative of Catalent’s improper accounting practices. These red flags included the rapid increase in Catalent’s contract asset and inventory balances, declining customer deposits, executive turnover, and recent scrutiny of the Company’s revenue accounting by regulators. The report also described how Catalent’s direct customers were stuffed with excess inventory which “will take years to unwind.” On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined 3.6 percent to close at $45.54 per share on December 8, 2022.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of Catalent securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

(NASDAQ: TSLA)  Class Period: February 19, 2019 - February 17, 2023  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2023  Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles, battery energy storage, solar panels and roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is headquartered in Austin, Texas and incorporated in Delaware. The Company’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “TSLA”.  In 2014, Tesla announced Tesla Autopilot (“Autopilot”), a suite of purportedly advanced driver-assistance system (“ADAS”) features including automated lane-centering, traffic-aware cruise control, lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation, and self-parking. In September 2014, all Tesla cars started shipping with the sensors and software necessary to support the Autopilot system. Since then, the Company has touted refinements and enhancements to the Company’s ADAS and Autopilot features, including so-called “Full Self-Driving” (“FSD”) software, which purportedly enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system.  Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants had significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company’s Autopilot and FSD technologies; (ii) contrary to Defendants’ representations, Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury associated with the operation of Tesla vehicles; (iii) all the foregoing subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm; and (iv) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.  On April 18, 2021, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle with “no one” driving it had crashed into a tree, killing two passengers near Houston, Texas in a “fiery” crash. A Harris County Precinct constable told local news station KPRC 2 that the investigation showed “no one was driving” the 2019 Tesla vehicle when the accident occurred.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $25.15 per share, or 3.4%, to close at $714.63 per share on April 19, 2021.  On August 16, 2021, media outlets reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) had opened a formal investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles. The scope of the investigation included 765,000 vehicles, or nearly every vehicle that Tesla has sold in the U.S. since the start of the 2014 model year.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $31.00 per share, or 4.32%, to close at $686.17 per share on August 16, 2021.  On June 3, 2022, media outlets reported that NHTSA had issued a formal inquiry to Tesla about the Autopilot and FSD features for certain models of its vehicles after receiving complaints from more than 750 owners of the vehicles about sudden and unexpected braking with no immediate cause.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $71.45 per share, or 9.22%, to close at $703.55 per share on June 3, 2022.  On January 27, 2023, media outlets reported that the SEC was investigating statements made by Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Defendant Elon R. Musk (“Musk”), concerning the Autopilot system, including whether Musk made inappropriate forward-looking statements regarding the Autopilot system.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $11.24 per share, or 6.32%, to close at $166.66 per share on January 30, 2023.  On February 16, 2023, media outlets reported that NHTSA had ordered a recall of nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the Company’s FSD “Beta” software, stating that the software may allow the equipped vehicles to act “in an unlawful or unpredictable manner,” increasing the risk of a crash.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $12.20 per share, or 5.69%, to close at $202.04 per share on February 16, 2023.  Then, on February 18, 2023, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle had crashed into a fire truck that was responding to an earlier accident, killing the driver and injuring a passenger and four firefighters. News reports linked the crash with prior reports of Tesla vehicles crashing into stationary emergency vehicles as a consequence of poorly performing ADAS technologies, increasing market and public concerns regarding the Autopilot system in Tesla’s vehicles.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $10.94 per share, or 5.25%, to close at $197.37 per share on February 21, 2023, the next trading day.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common stock, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.  For more information on the Tesla class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TSLA  DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO)  Class Period: In connection with the June 2021 IPO  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023  DLocal, which conducted its IPO in New York and trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “DLO,” connects global merchants to emerging markets, earning revenues from fees charged to merchants in connection with payment processing services for cross-border and local payment transactions.  In June 2021, Defendants (defined below) commenced DLocal’s IPO, issuing over 33.8 million shares at $21.00 per share, including the full exercise of the Underwriter Defendants’ (defined herein) option to purchase additional shares, all pursuant to the Registration Statement.  Among other things, the Registration Statement repeatedly touts DLocal’s supposed “growing and deepening relationships” with new and existing global merchant clients. The Registration Statement tells prospective investors that DLocal measures its success by means of its “cohort” performance in terms of TPV, or total payment volume, and offers historic TPV data to support the narrative that DLocal has a strong track record. In addition, the Registration Statement advises prospective investors that a remediation plan designed to improve the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting is being implemented, assuring the market that DLocal is serious about its internal controls over financial reporting.  The Registration Statement’s numerous representations about DLocal’s TPV and its internal controls over financial reporting, however, contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state material facts both required by governing regulations and necessary to make the statements made not misleading. Specifically, the Registration Statement misrepresents the TPV derived from new merchants in DLocal’s 2019 and 2020 cohorts, which, at the time of the IPO, were severely lower than what the Registration Statement reported, as well as the fact that the remediation plan DLocal implemented before the IPO was patently defective and, thus, incapable of improving the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.  When the truth regarding the Company’s TPV and internal controls reached the market, DLocal’s common stock cratered over 50%. All told, investors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.

(NASDAQ: CGNT)  Class Period: February 2, 2021 - June 28, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023  On December 16, 2021, after the market closed, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, issued a “Threat Report,” which included the results of its “months long” investigation into the “surveillance-for-hire industry,” revealing for the first time that Cognyte (along with six private companies) regularly targeted, without their knowledge, journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists around the world, and collected intelligence on these people by manipulating them to reveal information and/or by compromising their devices and accounts, in violation of Facebook’s “multiple community standards and Terms of Service.” In particular, the Threat Report revealed that Cognyte “sells access to its platform which enables managing fake accounts across social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and VKontakte (VK), and other websites to social-engineer people and collect data.” This conduct “violated multiple Community Standards and Terms of Service,” and “given the severity of their violations,” Meta disabled Cognyte’s ability to use its platforms (removing about 100 accounts on Facebook and Instagram), shared its findings with security researchers, other platforms, and policymakers, issued Cease and Desist warnings, and alerted the nearly 50,000 individuals (across 100 countries) who were believed to be targeted to help them strengthen the security of their accounts.  On this news, the price of Cognyte’s common stock fell 5.11%, closing on December 17, 2021, at $18 per share, before declining another 5.5% the next trading day. By December 22, 2021, Cognyte’s stock had fallen to trade at $15 per share, representing a decline of nearly 21%.  Then, on April 5, 2022, Cognyte issued its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the period ended January 31, 2022 (the “2021 Annual Report”), revealing that the Company was forced to modify its solutions in response to the Threat Report, stating in relevant part:  Our solutions capture, fuse and analyze data collected from various sources, including from commercial web sources and social platforms. Such sources and platforms may allege that our solutions and techniques for capturing and collecting data and information from such sources violate their terms of use or other propriety rights of such sources or of their users. In December 2021, Meta Platforms Inc., or Meta, issued a report alleging that certain solutions offered by us that interface with Facebook and Instagram platforms violate their terms of use. Concurrently with the issuance of the foregoing report, Meta announced that it had removed accounts that it claimed were associated with our solutions and requested we cease data collection from its social platforms. In response to Meta’s allegations, we made modifications to certain features of our solutions, which impacted the manner our customers can use these solutions. Any allegations that our solutions and techniques infringe the terms of use or rights of third parties may result in legal claims against us or our customers. These claims may damage our reputation, adversely impact our customer relationships and create liability for us.  On the same day it published its 2021 Annual Report, Cognyte reported its fourth quarter 2021 financial results, representing the period during which Facebook disrupted and disabled Cognyte’s use of its platforms for purposes of reconnaissance. Cognyte badly missed analyst consensus estimates for non-GAAP earnings per share and sales, and significantly undershot the midpoint of its guidance range by several millions of dollars, citing in the Company’s accompanying press release “lower conversions within [its] product pipeline,” among other macroenvironmental challenges. Specifically, the Company’s non-GAAP earnings of $0.16 per share were not only down significantly from the $0.36 per share it earned in the year-ago quarter but also $0.06 per share below analysts’ expectations of $0.22 per share. Similarly, Cognyte’s sales of $124.9 million, representing a less than 1% increase from the year-ago period, also came significantly below analysts’ consensus estimate of $129.6 million.  The response from analysts was swift with many reducing their price targets, including Wedbush, who lowered their price target from $17 to $9 and concluded: [T]he Cognyte business model is turning into a debacle of [ ] epic proportions for investors that once believed in the story. Since the spin-off from Verint over the past year, the Cognyte story ha[s] been a nightmare for investors as the execution shortfalls, longer sales cycles, and myriad of challenges has created a perfect storm for the Street. Most troubling to us is that CGNT was unable to guide for 1Q23 and 2023, which means to us that management may not have their arms around the sales execution and headwinds in our opinion.  The market also responded immediately and harshly. Cognyte’s stock price plummeted over 31% on unusually high trading volume, closing at $8.03 per share on April 5, 2022, which was down $3.63 per share from its April 4, 2022 close of $11.66 per share.  Then, on June 28, 2022, Cognyte released its first quarter 2022 financial results, which, once again, badly missed analyst estimates across the board. Cognyte’s 1Q22 revenue of $87 million, for example, represented a decline of 25%. Analysts were expecting a decline of 2%.  In response, analysts immediately downgraded the Company’s rating and reduced their price targets. William Blair, for example, downgraded Cognyte to “market perform” and concluded that Cognyte’s “low pipeline conversion” issues were a symptom of a broader problem, stating in relevant part:  Cognyte’s brand has been negatively impacted by increased scrutiny of the cyber intelligence industry and fellow Israel cyber surveillance firm NSO Group. Last fall, the U.S. government blacklisted the NSO Group after a multitude of reports surfaced that its software was being used inappropriately by governments to spy on citizens with dissenting views. While we believe there is value to cyber intelligence we believe that it is important for investors and customers that there are rigid safeguards in place and high transparency to ensure that the software is used in an ethical manner.  On this news, Cognyte’s shares declined $1.84, or over 28.66%, to close at $4.58 per share.

    "content": "BOSTON, March 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Circle Internet Financial, a global digital financial technology firm and the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), today announced it has joined LOT Network, a non-profit global community of companies that protects its members against Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs).\nPAEs acquire patents via third parties and try to make money through litigation against potential infringers. If a PAE acquires any patent asset that was once owned by a LOT Network member, all LOT Network members receive a license to that patent, protecting them from any potential litigation and fees. LOT Network covers more than 3.8 million patent assets from over 2,800 members across 56 countries. Circle is joining this collaborative community to reduce risk and encourage the development of products and services that bring real-world utility to the internet of value.\n\"Since our inception a decade ago, Circle and our products have been at the forefront of innovation and trust,\" said Daniel Kaleba, Assistant General Counsel, Litigation and IP, at Circle. \"Our membership with LOT Network champions the fair use of intellectual property and can protect the USDC infrastructure and ecosystem from patent exploitation, allowing us to focus on delivering internet-native financial services.\"\n\"I commend Circle for taking an important step in adding a measure of protection to their patent and IP strategy,\" said Ken Seddon, LOT Network CEO. \"Circle joins a growing number of financial technology companies as well as 12 of the largest holders of blockchain patents that are benefitting from the LOT agreement. With their membership in LOT, Circle and its customers can rest easy knowing that their funds are staying focused on producing great technology, attracting key talent and returning profits to shareholders versus being spent on draining resources that could put a company out of business.\"\nAbout Circle\nCircle is a global financial technology firm that enables businesses of all sizes to harness the power of digital currencies and public blockchains for payments, commerce and financial applications worldwide. Circle is powering always-on internet-native commerce, payments, and custody and is the issuer of USD Coin (USDC) and Euro Coin (EUROC).

With this announcement, OANDA completes its goal of allowing retail traders to trade CFDs on individual company shares, such as BP and Vodafone in the UK, and Tesla, Amazon, and Apple in the US.\nCommenting on this development, \nPhil Waters, \nHead of APAC & Emerging Markets, said: \"Interest in CFDs has been surging globally as they offer traders and investors the opportunity to profit from price changes without owning the underlying assets. CFDs give exposure to markets that are trending downward as well as upward, allowing traders to take positions even when volatility is high.\nEnabling clients to build leveraged exposure to the most popular listed corporations, including many familiar US companies across a variety of sectors, provides them with valuable diversification opportunities.\"\nUnder the launch, OANDA clients in emerging markets can now trade share CFDs on an intuitive platform alongside CFDs on a wide range of asset classes, such as indices, forex, commodities, metals, and bonds.\nFind out more: \nAbout OANDA\nFounded in 1996, OANDA was the first company to share exchange rate data free of charge on the Internet, launching an FX trading platform that helped pioneer the development of web-based currency trading five years later. Today, the OANDA group - which includes OANDA Global Markets and other subsidiaries of OANDA Global Corporation - provides online multi-asset trading, currency data and analytics to retail and corporate clients around the globe, demonstrating an unrivaled expertise in foreign exchange.\nWith regulated entities in many of the world's most active financial markets, OANDA remains dedicated to transforming how the world interacts with trading, enabling clients to trade global market indices, commodities, treasuries, precious metals and currencies on one of the fastest trading platforms in the market.

    "content": "Faster, lighter, quieter, and more cost effective than before, Blink’s new portable EV charger provides EV fleets with range confidence and creates new service offering for roadside assistance providers  Miami Beach, FL, March  15, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blink Charging Co. (Nasdaq: BLNK) (“Blink” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, today announced the immediate availability of its redesigned Blink mobile charger. The freestanding charger is built to provide emergency charging for stranded electric vehicles, directly addressing the needs of EV fleet operators, roadside assistance providers, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, and public roadway assistance programs.  The Blink mobile charger is rated at 32 amps and charges an EV with up to 0.5 to 1 mile of range per minute, allowing a stranded vehicle to receive adequate charge to drive to the nearest EV charging station and eliminates the need for the vehicle to be towed. The mobile charger is capable of Wi-Fi connectivity allowing roadside providers to charge EV drivers a flat fee or per usage during a roadside event. The unit is compatible with all electric vehicles and Level 2 fleet vehicles, including all Tesla models.  “We are excited to introduce our all-new, innovative portable EV charger that is available now. This product creates confidence for EV drivers and fleet operators that there is a reliable and cost-effective solution for vehicle rescue and uptime,” said Michael D. Farkas, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blink Charging. “The Blink Portable Charger reaffirms to our members and customers that Blink is actively committed to providing freedom and flexibility for EV drivers while continuing to expand our charging station footprint globally, building the infrastructure needed to benefit the growing number of emerging EVs.”  “The vehicle roadside assistance market continues to grow with projected estimates to reach nearly $35 billion globally by 2030. With the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, service providers require a solution that addresses EV owner’s needs,” continued Farkas. “We are pleased that demand for this product is already showing strength.”  The traditional gas-powered EV charger delivers a significant reduction in weight, size, noise and cost, from its predecessor model, making it more compact, accessible, and transportable but with the same reliable experience as the previous generation unit.

    "content": "BALTIMORE--(\nBUSINESS WIRE\n)--\nMyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n®\n(Nasdaq: MYMD) (“MyMD” or “the Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing groundbreaking therapies for the treatment of serious and debilitating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, today announced that it has joined\nLOT Network\n, the international, non-profit community of companies working together to protect themselves against litigation brought on by patent assertion entities (PAEs, also known as “patent trolls”). MyMD’s joining the LOT (License on Transfer) Network’s community of 2,800+ companies is intended to enable MyMD to protect the interests of the Company against patent assertion entities.\nThe LOT Network community is committed to protecting members against frivolous PAE litigation. Members agree that if, and only if, a member’s patent asset falls into the hands of a PAE, other members are granted a license to that patent – rendering them immune to a PAE lawsuit using that patent. With a total of 2,289 patent troll cases in 2022 alone,\n1\nthe average lawsuit costing $4 million to defend,\n2\nand 87% of patent assets used in PAE lawsuits originating from operating companies,\n3\nLOT Network’s coverage of nearly 4 million patent assets globally provides broad protection and peace of mind to member companies.\n“\nBiotech companies are increasingly finding themselves defending costly patent-troll lawsuits,” said Christopher Chapman, MD, Director, and Chief Medical Officer at MyMD Pharmaceuticals. “\nMyMD joins a growing number of life science companies leveraging LOT Network as a layer of protection against troll litigation, so that we can continue to focus our resources on our clinical development programs and protect our expansive IP portfolio and the interests of our shareholders.”\n“\nWe are pleased to welcome MyMD into LOT Network,” said Ken Seddon, CEO of LOT Network. “\nJoining the community demonstrates their commitment to preserving their resources for innovation and protecting their ecosystem against unwanted litigation.”\nAbout MyMD Pharmaceuticals\nMyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYMD), is a clinical stage biopharma company developing groundbreaking therapies for the treatment of serious and debilitating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. MyMD’s lead clinical candidate, MYMD-1®, is an orally available next-generation TNF-alpha inhibitor with the potential to transform the way that TNF-alpha based diseases are treated. MYMD-1®, with its small molecule design, improved safety profile and ability to cross the blood brain barrier, has the promise to provide meaningful therapeutic solutions to patients not served by current TNF-alpha inhibitors and as a potential therapy for CNS-based inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. MYMD-1 has demonstrated the potential to slow the aging process and extend healthy lifespan. The company is evaluating MYMD-1® in Phase 2 studies for sarcopenia/frailty, a result of the aging process, as well as early-stage trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with the potential to expand into other applications. MyMD’s second therapeutic candidate is Supera-CBD™, a novel, synthetic, non-toxic cannabidiol (CBD) analog that is 8000 times more potent a CB2 agonist (activator) than plant-based CBD. In addition to its potential role in managing addiction, anxiety, chronic pain and seizures, Supera-CBD has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.

TESLA'S NEW WINDSHIELD WIPER TECH GETS A PATENT  Tesla's first diner is set to be built in Hollywood. (Tesla)Tesla has also filed for trademark protection for its name to be used for restaurant services.  The company purchased a former Shakey's Pizza location for $16 million. (Google Street View)No further details were shared, like what is inside and expected to be on the menu; however, last year, Tesla purchased a $16 million property on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, California, to build on. The location used to be the home of a Shakey's Pizza.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE FOX NEWS AUTOS NEWSLETTERA firm timetable for construction has not been announced.  Tesla may soon offer a wireless charging mat for its cars. (Tesla)There was another teaser image posted alongside it that appeared to show a Tesla in a garage using a wireless charging mat on the floor, but the presenter did not reference either image directly, only saying that \"we also want to make sure that we continue to focus on providing really incredible charging experiences.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTesla does not currently offer the technology, which uses inductive charging like a smartphone charging pad, but it would allow owners to simply park their car over it to charge without having to plug it in.

To help inform the buildout of charging infrastructure across all neighborhoods of Denver, Hertz is sharing with the city anonymous, aggregated telematic insights from its fleet of connected cars through its \"Hertz Charging Opportunity Index.\"\nHertz is donating an electric vehicle and providing EV educational and training materials to Montbello Career and Technical High School to enable the school to incorporate EV technology into its auto servicing curriculum. Hertz is also making summer jobs available to young people in Denver, including through the Denver Youth Employment Program.\n\"Our partnership with Hertz and their donation of resources and an EV to Montbello Career and Technical High School is a groundbreaking new endeavor to teach young people new skills and prepare them for the next wave of technological advances,\" \nsaid Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock. \"We're targeting this initial effort right where it's most needed, and also partnering with the Denver Youth Employment Program to make sure there are similar opportunities across the city. These alliances will further educate our youth and put them on a path to success in the economy of tomorrow.\"\n\"At bp we know it's going to take a high level of coordination to transition to a net zero future,\" \nsaid Denver native and bp America chairman and president Dave Lawler. \"These public private partnerships are important, and equally important is engaging students early and often to ensure they have the right skills for the future. We can't do it without them. I commend Mayor Hancock and Hertz as we continue to make steady progress in Denver.\" \n\"Montbello Career and Technical houses the only high school automotive program in the far northeast region of Denver,\" \nsaid Arnetta Koger, Principal of Montbello Career and Technical High School.  \"We are glad to partner with Hertz and Denver. Now, with our first electric vehicle, we will be able to ensure that our students are preparing for the jobs and technologies of the future.\"\nIn January, Hertz announced Hertz Electrifies, a new public-private partnership aimed at accelerating the transition to electric vehicles, while creating economic opportunity and environmental benefits for communities. In addition, Hertz and bp have announced an intention to bring fast charging infrastructure to Hertz locations in major cities, including Denver.\nAbout Hertz Electrifies \nHertz Electrifies is a new public-private partnership aimed at furthering the mainstream adoption of electric vehicles and extending the benefits of electrification to communities throughout the United States.

    "content": "\nTesla Inc. will halt some production at its Shanghai factory until the end of February, as it upgrades the facility to start rolling out a revamped version of the Model 3 sedan in the competitive Chinese market.\nThe plant has two sections for vehicle manufacturing, and some workers on the first phase won’t be allowed on production lines as soon as Sunday as work on improving them is undertaken, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.\nTesla has been upgrading the lines in stages over the past two months, with deliveries of the new Model 3 sedan — which the company is yet to publicly confirm — expected to begin later this year, the people said. The section of the factory currently being worked on makes Model 3s and Model Y crossovers.\nThe revamp comes as Tesla faces increased competition in the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market. Model 3 sales in China have been declining, with about 125,000 of the sedans sold in 2022, a drop of 17 percent from the previous year. With local rivals like BYD Co. and Nio Inc. introducing rival models, Tesla has resorted to price cuts on China-built models to lift sales.\nStill, orders for made-in-China Teslas have started to flatten since the start of this month after an initial frenzy following the price cuts, one of the people said.\nMore than half of the 1.37 million EVs that Tesla built globally last year were made at the Shanghai factory, where cars first rolled off production lines in December 2019. After several upgrades, the facility — Tesla’s first outside the U.S. — has the capacity to produce about one million vehicles a year, more than double its original plan of 450,000.\nChina-based Tesla representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nTotal shipments of new-energy passenger vehicles to dealerships in China nearly doubled to 6.5 million in 2022, according to the Passenger Car Association, which expects a further 30 percent increase this year. Carmakers including Nio, Xpeng Inc. and Geely Automobile Holdings are all rolling out new models in a battle for market share.",

    "content": "DUBLIN--(\nBUSINESS WIRE\n)--The\n\"Gearing Up to Circular Autos: Opportunities from the Shift to Sustainable Mobility\"\nreport has been added to\nResearchAndMarkets.com's\noffering.\nCircular Autos represent a new vehicle class; fully-electric, connected vehicles built from the ground up with renewable resources and embedded recyclability.\nThey could be the silver bullet to the disruption the automotive industry faces; digitalization and sustainability amid the ripple effects of the worsening economic outlook. Circular Auto is the embodiment of clean, safe, and convenient movement of people and goods. Read this report to learn about the Top opportunities from the shift to Sustainable Mobility.\nThis report unveils the top opportunities in the transition to sustainable, electrified, connected, and shared mobility.\nRead this report to learn:\nHow can Circular Mobility lead the automotive transformation to sustainability;\nWhat is the impact of emission regulations and policies for Sustainable Vehicles;\nKey technological enablers and the pace of innovation for Circular Autos;\nTrends in consumer sentiment;\nStrategies to accelerate the transition to Sustainable Mobility\nThe evolving player Ecosystem: Leaders vs. Followers\nEmerging Circularity Hubs\nCircular Autos can address environmental goals and digital transformation\nCircularity and sustainability are becoming core parts of the strategic direction of carmakers and automotive suppliers due to emission regulations and climate policies, competition, and changing consumer needs.\nMany passenger car brands are already fully-electric, such as Tesla and Polestar. Still, their shift to climate neutrality is underway, with Tesla not making a commitment yet while Polestar has set 2040 as the goal.\nThe VW Group is targeting net carbon neutrality by 2050 with a combination of strategies that include a fully-electric car mix, off-setting unavoidable emissions, and many more. The VW Group expects its BEV mix to account for 20-25% of sales by 2025, amounting to 2-3 million units, of which VW will amount to circa 1 million.\nThe latest update of Renault Group's Renaulution plan will include creating a 360 circular economy company from the closed loop in materials to battery recycling, called \"The Future Is NEUTRAL\", an industry-first, according to the French carmaker.\nBMW aims at a 1/3 CO2 reduction across its value chain by 2030. The Group wants to become climate-neutral by 2050.\nPolestar and Volvo have set 2040 as their net-zero commitment target. Hyundai and KIA have set 2045.\nFord, VW, Mazda, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, and Isuzu have set 2050.\nZF, a major automotive supplier, is targeting net carbon neutrality by 2040. The company intends to incorporate sustainability as a unique selling proposition, from meeting the highest environmental standards in production to dealing with employees and being a reliable, ethical business partner\nRegulations are the biggest driver of transformation to Circular Autos. CO2 fleet compliance and targets for PHEV/BEV sales are increasing the cost of compliance of Internal Combustion Engines and driving the introduction of PHEVs and BEVs.\nWith the proliferation of electric vehicles, regulations are concerned about the environmental and social impact of EV batteries. The European Parliament is working on an update of the EU's battery directive to ensure that batteries can be repurposed, remanufactured or recycled at the end of their life.\nBut the shift to sustainability still faces adoption challenges\nA plethora of technological innovations in electric vehicle batteries, business models for 2nd life and recyclability, and industry collaboration will be crucial for the shift from Low to Full Circular Mobility.\nThe lack of regulatory harmonization, the absence of global cooperation to develop common standards, and consumer awareness are roadblocks to overcome.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1.

    "title": "Ferrari, Dodge fine-tune artificial noise for EVs",
    "content": "Future electric Ferraris could soon roar like the V-12 812 Competizione.\nHigh-performance car fans love the roar of V-8 and V-12 engines. But as vehicles using these powertrains start making way for electric vehicles, automakers including Stellantis and Ferrari are betting customers will still want to keep making noise with EVs.\nWhen Stellantis unveiled its Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Concept in August, the muscle-car brand debuted an industry-first exhaust system for EVs.\n“No, Dodge has not found a way for an electric car to pump equal parts engine noise and CO2 into the air,” Car and Driver wrote. It designed a system to amplify the near-silent hum of electric motors into “a 126-decibel cacophony worthy of the SRT badge.”\nFerrari too is working on a way to create distinctive noises tied to the actual performance of an EV powertrain, enabling drivers to not just feel but also hear realistic vehicle feedback.\nAnalysts at Oddo BHF last month flagged that the supercar maker had filed for a patent for its device, which could go into its first full-electric model coming in 2025.\nWhile the company has declined to comment on the device specifically, CEO Benedetto Vigna believes sound will be essential to any Ferrari, including those powered by battery.\n“I have no doubt that our electric powertrains will give clients the same thrills” as combustion engines, Vigna said in an interview.\n“The point is how to extract the best emotion from the use of this technology, giving something unique to the clients.”\nAutomakers have long fine-tuned the pitch that is emitted from their combustion engines, to the point that car buffs can name that tune when a particular generation Ford Mustang rolls up or distinguish between a Lamborghini or Bugatti roaring by.\nUnsurprisingly, enthusiasts with strong feelings about how a marque or model should sound have been unsparing in their early assessment of the Dodge concept’s mountain lion-like audio profile.\nBrand boss Tim Kuniskis told Motor Trend and Road & Track that much of the initial feedback about the Charger Daytona SRT Concept’s growl was negative, and that Dodge will keep refining it.\nThe distinct sounds brands such as Dodge and Ferrari are working on are much higher stakes than Tesla’s gimmicky “Fart Mode” that’s good for a laugh and little else.\nPerformance automakers will have their work cut out for them enticing customers to switch to a new type of drivetrain likely to render vehicles even more expensive.\nBecause EVs can barely be heard when going slowly, regulators in Europe, the U.S. and China have been requiring that they come with a built-in sound system that alerts bicyclists and pedestrians.\nAutomakers have a bit more room to maneuver with different sounds when EVs go faster and emit more tire and wind noise.\nSome have even turned to creative outsiders to give their vehicles a sonic edge.\nJaguar tapped electronic musician Richard Devine to design sounds for its first full EV, the i-Pace.\nVolkswagen hired Leslie Mandoki, a German-Hungarian music producer who has worked with Phil Collins and Chaka Khan, for the ID 3.\nBMW teamed with Oscar-winning film score composer Hans Zimmer — his works include Hollywood blockbusters Gladiator and The Lion King — to create special noises for its EVs, including a spaceship-like hum when powering up.\n“Ever since the industrial revolution and we have had combustion engines, the sound of cities — the sound of our lives — have been dictated by that,” Zimmer said in a video on the project.\n“Now, suddenly, we have the opportunity to change the sonic landscape of this whole planet.”",

    "content": "Includes self-propelled vacuum and mop, steam and ozone sanitization, a self-cleaning base and up to 82 minutes of cleaning timeBELLEVUE, Wash., Feb. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- eufy, Anker Innovation's smart appliance brand, today announced the launch of MACH, its new premium cleaning brand. MACH will deliver the most advanced solutions to home cleaning, combining the latest technology with never-before-seen features and sleek, modern aesthetics.\nContinue Reading\nEUFY UNVEILS THE MACH V1 ULTRA, THE WORLD'S FIRST CORDLESS STICK VACUUM WITH STEAM MOP\nTweet this\nMACH V1 Ultra from eufy is world's first cordless stick vacuum with steam mop.\n\"MACH represents a major breakthrough for the eufy brand,\" said Steven Yang, CEO of Anker Innovations. \"MACH is more than just a measurement of supersonic speed. It is about setting new standards and achieving the impossible, which is the philosophy behind eufy's new MACH brand. For a product to fall under the MACH umbrella, it must challenge the status quo, offering technology and innovation that defy expectations. The V1 Ultra is just the beginning, and we look forward to sharing details of other products under our new MACH brand soon.\"\nFeaturing a sleek, futuristic design, the \nMACH V1 Ultra sets a new precedent as the world's first cordless vacuum with steam-mopping capabilities.\nOther notable features include:\nSteamWave™ TechnologyThe SteamWave™ technology works by first dissolving the stain and then vacuuming and mopping the surface. The steam is continually released at a higher temperature of 230℉ to remove dirt and bacteria. The V1 Ultra is equipped with overheat protection, which pauses the steam delivery whenever the vacuum is lifted off the ground. This technology makes the V1 Ultra the world's first cordless stick vacuum with steam and mopping capabilities for a streamlined way to clean up any type of mess in a single pass without having to juggle cords.\nEco-Clean Ozone™ Disinfection and Tesla Valve Mixing™ TechnologyThis sterilization technology is used to sanitize the floor, and later, sanitizes the vacuum itself, including the rolling brush. Upon disinfecting the floor, the ozone breaks down into oxygen, making it non-toxic and most importantly, effective. According to a study done by the Technical Inspection Association (TUV) and Environmental Protection Agency, ozone technology reduces germs by up to 99%. For this reason, the V1 Ultra was awarded the first TUV certificate for a product of this caliber.The V1 Ultra includes a built-in generator with Tesla Valve Mixing™ technology that precisely proportions and mixes the cleaning solution with the water and, with the push of a button, releases the proper amount of solution for optimal cleaning. It can store up to 30 days of cleaning solution.\nJetStream™ Powerful Suction with Noise-Canceling TechnologyEquipped with suction power of 16,800Pa, perfect for picking up messes on hard floors, the V1 Ultra also comes with three-layered noise-canceling technology that ensures noise levels stay below 65dB, about the same level as a dishwasher.\nFuturistic DesignThe transparent design of the body of the vacuum allows users to see the dirt, stains and messes cleaned by the V1 Ultra. The stick vacuum is slender and lightweight and includes an LCD display on the handle for operations and alerts.The V1 Ultra also includes the following design features:\nJetBlade™ Anti-Slip - This feature emits air to dry the floor as it mops, minimizing the risk of slipping on hardwood floors.\nTriple Self-Clean System - The V1 Ultra has a three-fold self-cleaning system that cleans, disinfects and dries the rolling brush, tube and vacuum body at the same time with the press of a button.\nLong-Lasting Battery - This cordless stick vacuum is powered by Anker's industry leading battery technology and offers 82 minutes* of runtime on a single charge.\n*When using Smart Mode. Battery life will vary depending on mode used.\nProduct Specifications\nPricing & AvailabilityThe MACH V1 Ultra is available now in the US with optional Try Now, Buy Later from TryNow on eufy.com with an included accessory package and two bottles of cleaning solution valued over $100. It will be available for general retail purchase on March 15, 2023 on eufy.com, Amazon.com and BestBuy.com for $699.99.

    "content": " close      Video Funky features on Tesla's Cybertruck Check out the Tesla CybertruckTesla has received a patent for a new type of windshield wiper that it has designed for electric and autonomous cars.The automaker originally filed to protect it in 2019, but the patent was not issued until this January.The \"electromagnetic windshield wiper system\" replaces the traditional setup, where wiper arm s are attached to fixed electric motors that sweep them across an arc.Instead, it features a linear actuator installed at the bottom of the windshield along which a box moves back and forth like a magnetic train.TESLA CYBERTRUCK SPOTTED WITH STRANGE NEW FEATURE  Tesla's patent uses electromagnetic actuators to move the wiper. (Tesla)Tesla says the low friction setup is more energy efficient and less susceptible to wear and corrosion than an electric motor. The arm is attached to the block along with a magnetic rotational actuator that can sweep it as the block moves its base.According to the patent, this allows for more coverage of the glass and can also keep the blade better attached to the surface, especially if it is curved. It also provides for the wiper to be parked horizontally and hidden under the hood when not in use for improved aerodynamics.   Tesla says the system is more energy efficient. (Tesla)Tesla has not shown any vehicles equipped with the design yet. In fact, its next model features the complete opposite.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE FOX NEWS AUTOS NEWSLETTERCybertruck prototypes have been spotted with a single giant wiper attached to the bottom corner of the windshield that sits upright along the driver's side, but still does not appear to be able to reach as much of the glass as would be ideal.  The Cybertruck uses a single wiper attached to the bottom corner of the windshield.  (SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images)\"The wiper is what troubles me most. No easy solution. Deployable wiper that stows in front trunk would be ideal, but complex,\" Tesla's CEO wrote on Twitter last year commenting on the design.  A Cybertruck was photographed w2ith a half-size windshield wiper. (Photographer: Nic Coury/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Another Cybertruck has also been photographed with what appears to be a wiper arm that is half the size and possibly capable of folding like a switchblade, but there has been no official comment on how it works.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The patent is no guarantee the wiper system will be put into production, but Elon Musk said the Cybertruck definitely will be sometime this year, when its wiper design will be finalized.

    "title": "Otter Surpasses 1 Billion Meetings Transcribed and Launches OtterPilot™: The Smart AI Meeting Assistant to Eliminate Note-taking and Automate Meeting Summaries",
    "content": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(\nBUSINESS WIRE\n)--\nOtter.ai\nis launching OtterPilot\n™\n, the smart AI meeting assistant that automates meetings from start to finish to help professionals and teams save time and increase meeting productivity. OtterPilot uses AI to automate the entire meeting process with automated live notes (auto-join and auto-share), automated slide capture, and automated summaries. The launch comes at a significant milestone for the company, with millions of professionals trusting Otter for their meeting notes, Otter has reached the milestone of transcribing over 1 billion meetings.\nIn\nOtter’s recent report on the cost of unnecessary meetings\n, it became clear that professionals and organizations are experiencing an overload of meetings, costing employers millions of dollars and zapping employee morale and productivity.\nNow there is an easy way to collaborate and increase meeting productivity by leveraging the power of an AI assistant to transcribe and summarize meeting takeaways automatically, so not everyone needs to attend every meeting, and those that do can engage without distractions of note-taking. OtterPilot doesn’t just reduce the need to attend every meeting, it also enhances the ones you do attend by saving you time during the meeting and afterwards. OtterPilot eliminates the need to take manual notes during the meeting and sends out a meeting summary that includes images of the meeting slides.\n“AI is helping us in every aspect of our life. Every day when I drive to work, I am helped and inspired by advancements in Tesla’s Autopilot system,” says Sam Liang, co-founder and CEO of Otter.ai. “Similarly, we’ve seen the huge improvements in Otter’s AI capabilities, and now our OtterPilot promises to eliminate note-taking, save time, and improve meeting productivity for our user’s next billion meetings.”\nWhen professionals and teams put their meetings on OtterPilot, this is what it looks like:\nAutomated Meeting Notes\nOtter leverages its proprietary AI to write meeting notes in real time and share them with everyone so they can collaborate during meetings. When connected to a user’s Microsoft or Google calendar, Otter can automatically join virtual meetings. Meeting attendees can view the live transcript, add comments, highlight key points, and even assign action items during the meeting. All of these takeaways are stored alongside the meeting notes for easy recall. Otter can automatically share the Otter notes with those invited to the meeting and/or to a specific group. Why should everyone have to attend every meeting to get the meeting information?\nAutomated Slide Capture\nNow with OtterPilot, users can automatically capture images of slides shared during virtual meetings. Whenever a slide presentation or visual is shared in a virtual meeting, Otter automatically captures it and inserts it into the meeting notes. This way, individuals and teams can easily search for and recall important slides along with the transcript to remember what was shared.\nAutomated Summary\nSave time with Otter’s automated meeting summary - an AI-generated summarization of the key meeting topics. After each meeting, Otter will automatically send a summary to those invited to the meeting and/or directly to an Otter group. Automated summaries are shared via email, with hyperlinks to key moments and slide captures of the meeting.\nOtterPilot features will roll out to users on all plans over the coming days.\nWant to join millions of professionals and organizations and put your meetings on OtterPilot so you can save time and improve team collaboration?\nGive OtterPilot a try for free here\n.\nAnd, if you want to bring Otter to your company, now’s the time.\nContact our sales team here to learn more.\nAbout Otter.ai\nWith over 1B meetings transcribed, Otter.ai is the world’s leading tool for meeting transcription, summarization, and collaboration. Using artificial intelligence, Otter generates real-time automated meeting notes, summaries, and other insights from in-person and virtual meetings - turning meetings into accessible, collaborative, and actionable data that can be shared across teams and organizations. The company is backed by early investors in Google, DeepMind, Zoom, and Tesla.",

    "title": "Ford set to announce $3.5 billion EV battery plant in Michigan, sources say",
    "content": "Michigan has been marketing its marquee, 1,900-acre megasite in Calhoun County near I-69 and I-94 — some 10 miles east of Battle Creek, Mich.\nFord Motor Co. on Monday plans to announce details of a massive electric vehicle battery plant it has decided to build in Marshall, Mich., two people with knowledge of the company's plans told Crain's Detroit Business, an affiliate of Automotive News.\nThe automaker is scheduled to hold a news event at Ford Ion Park in Romulus on Monday, according to an advisory Ford sent Friday.\nThe event will be centered on how Ford \"is working to scale EVs quickly and, ultimately, make them more accessible to customers,\" Ford said.\nRelated Article\nFord-CATL EV battery plant being 'aggressively' pursued by Michigan\nFord, CATL mull battery plant in Mich. amid U.S.-China tensions, report says\nThe announcement will include details about the $3.5 billion factory and 2,500 new jobs in Marshall, the two officials told Crain's.\nThe state has offered $1 billion in incentives, including cash and site development funds, from Michigan's Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, one of the sources said. The account has around $200 million that is not spoken for. Lawmakers will be asked to add $800 million in a supplemental spending bill.\n\"Several Ford executives will be part of the briefing and go more in depth on the plans,\" the Ford advisory said.  A spokesman for the automaker declined to comment beyond the advisory.\nWhile the automaker has not confirmed details of the project, Michigan has been competing for a $3.5 billion lithium iron phosphate factory planned by Ford and Chinese battery giant CATL.\nThe plant would be near the intersection of Interstates 69 and 94, both key commercial corridors.\nThe project would transform a small town in south-central Michigan, some 10 miles from Battle Creek, that has suffered population and job loss in recent years.\nLanding the plant also represents a redemption of sorts for Michigan in its quest to maintain automotive dominance. Ford sent shock waves through the state in 2021 when it announced it would be venturing away from home to invest $11 billion in EV plants and create thousands of jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee.\nThe Ford-CATL plant has not been without controversy.\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said last month that he removed his state from consideration for the factory — Michigan's only publicly known competitor for the plant — because it would serve as a \"Trojan horse\" for China into the U.S., helping the Far East bolster its EV battery dominance and spread its influence.\nFord has not detailed the exact makeup of its partnership with CATL, but a source close to the plan said it would be unlike a traditional joint venture in that Ford would own the plant with employees on its payroll, while CATL would provide battery technology and expertise.\nFord EV targets\nFord is looking to increase its annual global EV production to 600,000 vehicles by late 2023 and 2 million by 2026 as it looks to gain ground on EV market leader Tesla Inc.\nOther automakers are also rushing to set up new plants to support a rapid expansion of EV production.\nGeneral Motors announced last year it would invest $6.5 billion for EV projects in Orion Township, Mich., and the Lansing suburb of Delta Township.\nStellantis NV's move last year to invest more than $2.5 billion and create 1,400 new jobs for an EV plant in Kokomo, Ind., also was a blow to Michigan, but the automaker is searching for a home for another battery plant.\nMichigan is in play for it, and an announcement is expected in the second quarter, a Stellantis spokeswoman confirmed.\nThe Michigan Economic Development Corp. has said it is aggressively competing for other large battery and semiconductor projects.\n\"Michigan is always talking to Ford and any of our large employers,\" MEDC CEO Quentin Messer told Crain's Detroit Business last month. \"We talk in general about making sure that Michigan remains a competitive environment for opportunity.\"",

    "content": "\nHertz Global Holdings Inc. ended last year with far fewer Tesla Inc. vehicles in its fleet than planned when the rental-car company was plotting its late 2021 stock listing.\nIn an annual regulatory filing Tuesday, Hertz said its rental fleet in the Americas peaked at 428,700 vehicles last year, and that Teslas were 11 percent of its fleet. That means Hertz had fewer than 50,000 Teslas in its fleet — less than half the 100,000 the company said it would order by the end of 2022.\nHertz’s October 2021 announcement of its Tesla order sent the electric-vehicle maker’s valuation soaring past $1 trillion for the first time. It also helped drum up interest in the rental-car company, which staged its post-bankruptcy public offering two weeks later.\nRelated Articles\nHertz orders 100,000 Tesla vehicles for end of 2022; Tesla's worth reaches $1 trillion\nHertz Electrifies program launches in Denver\nElon Musk tempered Tesla’s stock rally somewhat days after Hertz made its announcement, tweeting that no contract had been signed and that the EV maker had far more demand than production. Tesla’s market capitalization was $616.2 billion at the close of trading Monday.\nHertz’s filing provides some clues as to why it’s added far fewer Teslas than the car renter said it would order. The first risk factor the company lists pertaining to its EV initiatives is that the strategy depends on the “ability to secure adequate vehicle supply within the time frame we, and our customers, expect.”\nAnother factor that may have come into play: Tesla raised prices on several occasions last year, which might have made acquiring cars costlier than Hertz expected. That’s less of an issue after Tesla slashed prices across its lineup last month.\n \nBloomberg",
