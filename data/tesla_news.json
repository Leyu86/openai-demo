    "content": "FinancialNewsMedia.com News Commentary \nPALM BEACH, Fla., April 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- North America needs to race to find new supplies and production of lithium as automakers ramp up manufacturing of electric vehicles and demand grows for renewable energy options. Lithium is used in electric car batteries because it is lightweight, can store lots of energy and can be repeatedly recharged. Analysts estimate that lithium demand is going to increase tenfold before the end of this decade as big manufacturers such as Tesla, Volkswagen, General Motors and other automakers introduce dozens of electric models. Other ingredients like cobalt are needed to keep the battery stable.  Most of the raw lithium used domestically comes from Latin America or Australia, and most of it is processed and turned into battery cells in China and other Asian countries.  Global demand for lithium batteries is expected to surge more than five-fold by 2030, public-private alliance Li-Bridge said recently, as more people opt for electric vehicles and energy storage systems.  Demand for lithium batteries in the United States is expected to grow more than six times and translate into $55 billion per year by the end of the decade, but still the country is expected to depend on imports for supply, the report added.  Active mining companies in the markets this week include:  \nIndigo Exploration Inc. (OTCQB: IXIXF) (TSX-V: IXI), \nLithiumBank Resources Corp. (\nOTCQX: LBNKF) (\nTSX-V: LBNK), \nAtlas Lithium Corporation (NASDAQ: ATLX), \nAllied Copper Corp. (OTCQB: CPRRF) (TSX-V: CPR), \nBrunswick Exploration Inc. (OTCQB: BRXWF) (TSX-V: BRW).\nThe article continued: \"Demand for EVs has soared over the past few years, as climate-conscious consumers snap up cars with electric powertrains, amid soaring fuel prices.  Lithium batteries that would power a range of vehicles over the next few years will also be essential to military systems and consumer, medical, and industrial electronics.  According to the Li-Bridge report, under current conditions U.S. companies and workers will capture less than 30% of the value of cells consumed domestically.  \"The lack of a substantial lithium battery supply chain in the United States and the lack of secure access to energy materials pose serious threats to U.S. national and economic security,\" Li-Bridge said.\nIndigo Exploration Inc. (OTCQB: IXIXF) (TSX-V: IXI) \nBREAKING NEWS:  Indigo Exploration Engages GLJ Ltd. To Conduct Inaugural Sampling Program - Indigo Exploration Inc. (the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the engagement of GLJ Ltd. (\"GLJ\") to oversee a sampling and brine testing study of Indigo's Fox Creek West and Fox Creek East Projects, located in west-central Alberta (c.f. Figure 1), approximately 250 km northwest of Edmonton. GLJ is one of the premiere global energy consultants with over 50 years of experience in meeting the world's need for responsible, sustainable energy. Their team of engineers, geoscientists and business professionals are international leaders in both traditional and emerging energy services in best-in-class reservoir engineering and geoscience advisory and evaluation services for the energy industry.\n\"We are excited to lay the foundation for the sampling of our lithium projects, with the first being our Fox Creek projects, which will culminate in the tabling of a maiden lithium brine resource by the fall of this year. The engagement of world-renowned GLJ Ltd. not only demonstrates our commitment to working with leaders in the industry but also a testament to the calibre of talent our project attracts\" commented CEO, Paul Cowley.\nIndigo is currently working with several oil and gas operators, with active producing wells on the permits, to collect brine samples that will be used to estimate potential resource in place and verify historical results.  These samples are expected to be used to complete a preliminary NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate. \nCONTINUED… \nRead this and more news for Indigo Exploration at:  \nIn other market news of interest:\nAtlas Lithium Corporation (NASDAQ: ATLX), a mineral exploration company with over 75,000 acres of hard-rock lithium mineral rights, recently identified lithium mineralization that is both superficial and high-grade. Atlas Lithium's intersect of 4.40% Li2O in its drill hole DHAB-68 is one of the highest grades reported at a spodumene deposit in Minas Gerais' Lithium Valley based on publicly-available data. Drill hole DHAB-68 is located at the southwestern portion of Atlas Lithium's 1.1 kilometer-long Anitta pegmatite target (\"Anitta\"), which remains open for expansion along strike and at depth.\nIn DHAB-68, the lithium mineralization intersects comprised a total of 43.61 meters, including a 25.43-meter interval with an average concentration of 1.44% Li2O. Importantly, in DHAB-68, lithium mineralization started at a depth of only 26.28 meters, which is considered superficial. Such relative high-grade and superficial lithium mineralization has also been observed in qualitative analysis of core samples from nearby drill holes for which the geochemical data is forthcoming. Overall, in the opinion of the Company's technical team, such results enhance the likelihood of an open pit operation for extraction. Mining engineering considerations are key when assessing the economic potential of a hard-rock lithium deposit.\nAllied Copper Corp. (TSX-V: CPR) (OTCQB: CPRRF), is pleased to announce 99.9% approval by shareholders for the Company name change to Volt Lithium Corp. (\"Volt\" or the \"Company\") at the Special Meeting of Shareholders held yesterday, April 20, 2023. This name change represents another critical step in the corporate transition to Volt, a lithium development and technology company aiming to be North America's first commercial producer of lithium from oilfield brine.\nIn addition, the shareholders also overwhelmingly approved the expansion of the board to six members, and the election of Mr. Maury Dumba to the board. Maury brings over 34 years of oil and gas industry experience across North America, having held executive leadership roles and management positions in Corporate Development and Marketing.\nBrunswick Exploration Inc. (OTCQB: BRXWF) (TSX-V: BRW) is pleased to announce that the Anatacau West maiden drill program has been completed and that drilling has intersected multiple spodumene-bearing pegmatites. The Anatacau West Project is located in the Eeyou Istchee-James Bay region of Quebec near Allkem's James Bay Lithium Project.\nMr. Killian Charles, President and CEO of BRW, commented: \"We are pleased that we have successfully identified significant spodumene mineralization in our maiden drilling campaign. Several lithium pegmatite dykes were intersected that remain open at depth and along strike to the south. While the Anatacau West Project remains poorly explored and merits further work this summer, we remain focused on continuing our ambitious Canada-wide exploration campaign as we seek to delineate new prospective lithium-bearing pegmatites. This phase of drilling at Anatacau West is over and we now look forward to sharing more details on our next drill campaign at the Hearst Project before the end of the month.\"\nLithiumBank Resources Corp. (TSX-V: LBNK) (OTCQX: LBNKF) is pleased to announce it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding \"(MoU\") with ZS2 Technologies Inc. (\"ZS2\"). The MoU will enable ZS2 to deploy their proprietary and patented CO2 Direct-Air-Capture (\"DAC\") technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions from the Boardwalk and Park Place projects in central Alberta, Canada. ZS2 will also further process treated brine to collect magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) for use in their proprietary magnesium cement products.\n\"In our view, partnering with the extraordinary team at ZS2 is truly a game-changer in the lithium brine industry,\" commented Paul Matysek, Executive Chairman, LithiumBank. \"The potential to be a carbon neutral lithium producer in Alberta has been a goal of the Company from the outset and we now have a line of sight to achieving our goal. We are very excited to collaborate with ZS2 Technologies and enhance the economic and environmental benefits of our Alberta brine projects. Beyond just the value of carbon capture, we will be able to co-produce other critical minerals like magnesium as well as reducing our brine reinjection requirements. Our agreement will allow ZS2 to produce a high demand, low-carbon cement product among other by-products that can be used in our lithium processing facility further reducing our operating costs. We look forward to expanding and enhancing our partnership as we move towards a carbon neutral combined lithium-magnesium-calcium commercial production facility that will set LithiumBank apart from its peers.\"\nDISCLAIMER:  FN Media Group LLC (FNM), which owns and operates FinancialNewsMedia.com and MarketNewsUpdates.com, is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

    "authors": [
      "Grant  Weisberg"
    ],
    "content": "NEW YORK, April  17, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO), and Cognyte Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CGNT). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT)  Class Period: August 30, 2021 - October 31, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 25, 2023  This case is about the rise and fall of a company that initially benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic (also referred to herein as “COVID-19,” “COVID,” or the “pandemic”). As a vaccine manufacturer, Catalent was one of the beneficiaries of COVID because it seemed well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for vaccine production capacity. Indeed, Catalent almost doubled its business during the first year of the pandemic when the bulk of vaccines were administered. Catalent’s success during the early stages of the pandemic caused its stock price to soar to record highs. By mid-2021, when COVID-related work dropped off, Defendants engaged in accounting and channel stuffing schemes to pad the Company’s revenues. These schemes gave Catalent the appearance of continued growth, causing its stock price to reach new record highs. Meanwhile, to support these schemes and keep pace with its lofty growth targets, Catalent was cutting corners on safety and control procedures at key production facilities. By late 2022, Catalent reported significant sales declines and excess inventory throughout its supply chain. As a result, Catalent stock dropped to pre-COVID levels causing substantial losses to its investors as they learned that Catalent’s early-COVID revenues were never sustainable, and its Class Period revenues were the product of securities fraud.  By way of background, Catalent is a multinational corporation that manufactures and packages drugs into delivery devices fit for human consumption (i.e., pre-filled syringes, vials, pills, etc.) pursuant to long-term supply contracts with pharmaceutical companies. Catalent directly sells these products to pharmaceutical companies which later sell them through the supply chain to healthcare providers (i.e., hospitals, clinics, etc.), which administer them to patients, who are the end consumers.   Prior to the onset of the pandemic, Catalent’s quarterly revenue averaged approximately $669 million between April 2018 and March 2020. During the period that those revenues were reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of approximately $47.57 per share. In early 2020, Catalent took on numerous large-scale COVID projects, including filling vaccines into syringes for Moderna and AstraZeneca. Those projects catapulted the Company’s quarterly revenues to record highs, which averaged approximately $940 million between April 2020 and March 2021, a 40 percent jump over preCOVID revenues. Over the period when that revenue surge was reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of $102.42 per share.  By mid-2021, as the pandemic wore on, demand for Catalent’s COVID products decreased because vaccinations had already been administered to a large number of potential patients. For example, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) data indicates that COVID vaccinations in the United States reached an all-time high of 4.5 million doses on April 1, 2021, and averaged 1.5 million daily doses between December 14, 2020 and August 28, 2021. By comparison, CDC data indicates that average daily vaccinations in the United States were under 625,000 during the Class Period.  Despite this marked decline in the demand for COVID vaccines, Catalent continued to report growing revenues and assured investors that customer demand remained strong during the Class Period. The average quarterly revenue reported during the Class Period was $1.2 billion, an 80 percent increase over preCOVID-19 revenues and a 28 percent increase over its reported revenues for the first year of the pandemic. Unbeknownst to investors, Defendants artificially inflated these revenues through fraudulent accounting and channel stuffing schemes to mislead investors into believing that Catalent was generatingsustainable revenue growth. Defendants’ fraud caused Catalent stock to trade at a record high of $142.64 per share on September 9, 2021 and an average closing price of approximately $108.00 per share during the Class Period.  Statements made by Defendants throughout the Class Period were materially false and misleading when made because they misrepresented or failed to disclose the following adverse facts, which were known to Defendants or recklessly disregarded by them:  a. Catalent materially overstated its revenue and earnings by prematurely recognizing revenue in violation of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”);  b. Catalent had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to revenue recognition;  c. Catalent falsely represented demand for its products while it knowingly sold more product to its direct customers than could be sold to healthcare providers and end consumers;  d. Catalent disregarded regulatory rules at key production facilities in order to rapidly produce excess inventory that was used to pad the Company’s financial results through premature revenue recognition in violation of GAAP and/or stuffing its direct customers with this excess inventory; and  e. As a result of the foregoing, Defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company’s financial performance, outlook, and regulatory compliance during the Class Period.  Catalent’s misrepresentations were first revealed to the market on August 29, 2022, when the Company disclosed that demand for its COVID-related products was facing substantial headwinds. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 7.4 percent to close at $92.28 per share on August 29, 2022.  Then, on September 20, 2022, a Washington Post report exposed that the release of COVID-19 vaccines produced by Catalent had been delayed by regulators because of improper sterilization at one of Catalent’s key facilities. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 9.3 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $79.06 per share on September 22, 2022.  On November 1, 2022, Catalent revealed that its quarterly earnings had declined to zero and lowered its financial guidance, indicating falling demand. The Company also disclosed that regulatory issues at its key facilities were negatively impacting its financial results. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 31.7 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $44.90 per share on November 2, 2022. All told, over the course of the Class period, Catalent stock fell from a high above $142.00 to close at $44.90 on November 2, 2022, a more than 68 percent decline.  On November 16, 2022, Catalent revealed that it was carrying approximately $400 million in excess inventory, further revealing that the Company had misrepresented demand for its products as well as its purported ability to predict future demand. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 8.5 percent, over two trading sessions, to close at $42.07 per share on November 17, 2022.  Then, on December 8, 2022, GlassHouse Research published a report claiming that Catalent had been materially overstating its revenues by $568.2 million in violation of GAAP. The report detailed numerous red flags that were indicative of Catalent’s improper accounting practices. These red flags included the rapid increase in Catalent’s contract asset and inventory balances, declining customer deposits, executive turnover, and recent scrutiny of the Company’s revenue accounting by regulators. The report also described how Catalent’s direct customers were stuffed with excess inventory which “will take years to unwind.” On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined 3.6 percent to close at $45.54 per share on December 8, 2022.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of Catalent securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

(NASDAQ: TSLA)  Class Period: February 19, 2019 - February 17, 2023  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2023  Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles, battery energy storage, solar panels and roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is headquartered in Austin, Texas and incorporated in Delaware. The Company’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “TSLA”.  In 2014, Tesla announced Tesla Autopilot (“Autopilot”), a suite of purportedly advanced driver-assistance system (“ADAS”) features including automated lane-centering, traffic-aware cruise control, lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation, and self-parking. In September 2014, all Tesla cars started shipping with the sensors and software necessary to support the Autopilot system. Since then, the Company has touted refinements and enhancements to the Company’s ADAS and Autopilot features, including so-called “Full Self-Driving” (“FSD”) software, which purportedly enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system.  Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants had significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company’s Autopilot and FSD technologies; (ii) contrary to Defendants’ representations, Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury associated with the operation of Tesla vehicles; (iii) all the foregoing subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm; and (iv) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.  On April 18, 2021, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle with “no one” driving it had crashed into a tree, killing two passengers near Houston, Texas in a “fiery” crash. A Harris County Precinct constable told local news station KPRC 2 that the investigation showed “no one was driving” the 2019 Tesla vehicle when the accident occurred.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $25.15 per share, or 3.4%, to close at $714.63 per share on April 19, 2021.  On August 16, 2021, media outlets reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) had opened a formal investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles. The scope of the investigation included 765,000 vehicles, or nearly every vehicle that Tesla has sold in the U.S. since the start of the 2014 model year.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $31.00 per share, or 4.32%, to close at $686.17 per share on August 16, 2021.  On June 3, 2022, media outlets reported that NHTSA had issued a formal inquiry to Tesla about the Autopilot and FSD features for certain models of its vehicles after receiving complaints from more than 750 owners of the vehicles about sudden and unexpected braking with no immediate cause.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $71.45 per share, or 9.22%, to close at $703.55 per share on June 3, 2022.  On January 27, 2023, media outlets reported that the SEC was investigating statements made by Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Defendant Elon R. Musk (“Musk”), concerning the Autopilot system, including whether Musk made inappropriate forward-looking statements regarding the Autopilot system.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $11.24 per share, or 6.32%, to close at $166.66 per share on January 30, 2023.  On February 16, 2023, media outlets reported that NHTSA had ordered a recall of nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the Company’s FSD “Beta” software, stating that the software may allow the equipped vehicles to act “in an unlawful or unpredictable manner,” increasing the risk of a crash.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $12.20 per share, or 5.69%, to close at $202.04 per share on February 16, 2023.  Then, on February 18, 2023, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle had crashed into a fire truck that was responding to an earlier accident, killing the driver and injuring a passenger and four firefighters. News reports linked the crash with prior reports of Tesla vehicles crashing into stationary emergency vehicles as a consequence of poorly performing ADAS technologies, increasing market and public concerns regarding the Autopilot system in Tesla’s vehicles.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $10.94 per share, or 5.25%, to close at $197.37 per share on February 21, 2023, the next trading day.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common stock, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.  For more information on the Tesla class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TSLA  DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO)  Class Period: In connection with the June 2021 IPO  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023  DLocal, which conducted its IPO in New York and trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “DLO,” connects global merchants to emerging markets, earning revenues from fees charged to merchants in connection with payment processing services for cross-border and local payment transactions.  In June 2021, Defendants (defined below) commenced DLocal’s IPO, issuing over 33.8 million shares at $21.00 per share, including the full exercise of the Underwriter Defendants’ (defined herein) option to purchase additional shares, all pursuant to the Registration Statement.  Among other things, the Registration Statement repeatedly touts DLocal’s supposed “growing and deepening relationships” with new and existing global merchant clients. The Registration Statement tells prospective investors that DLocal measures its success by means of its “cohort” performance in terms of TPV, or total payment volume, and offers historic TPV data to support the narrative that DLocal has a strong track record. In addition, the Registration Statement advises prospective investors that a remediation plan designed to improve the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting is being implemented, assuring the market that DLocal is serious about its internal controls over financial reporting.  The Registration Statement’s numerous representations about DLocal’s TPV and its internal controls over financial reporting, however, contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state material facts both required by governing regulations and necessary to make the statements made not misleading. Specifically, the Registration Statement misrepresents the TPV derived from new merchants in DLocal’s 2019 and 2020 cohorts, which, at the time of the IPO, were severely lower than what the Registration Statement reported, as well as the fact that the remediation plan DLocal implemented before the IPO was patently defective and, thus, incapable of improving the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.  When the truth regarding the Company’s TPV and internal controls reached the market, DLocal’s common stock cratered over 50%. All told, investors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.  For more information on the DLocal class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DLO  Cognyte Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CGNT)  Class Period: February 2, 2021 - June 28, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023  On December 16, 2021, after the market closed, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, issued a “Threat Report,” which included the results of its “months long” investigation into the “surveillance-for-hire industry,” revealing for the first time that Cognyte (along with six private companies) regularly targeted, without their knowledge, journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists around the world, and collected intelligence on these people by manipulating them to reveal information and/or by compromising their devices and accounts, in violation of Facebook’s “multiple community standards and Terms of Service.” In particular, the Threat Report revealed that Cognyte “sells access to its platform which enables managing fake accounts across social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and VKontakte (VK), and other websites to social-engineer people and collect data.” This conduct “violated multiple Community Standards and Terms of Service,” and “given the severity of their violations,” Meta disabled Cognyte’s ability to use its platforms (removing about 100 accounts on Facebook and Instagram), shared is findings with security researchers, other platforms, and policymakers, issued Cease and Desist warnings, and alerted the nearly 50,000 individuals (across 100 countries) who were believed to be targeted to help them strengthen the security of their accounts.  On this news, the price of Cognyte’s common stock fell 5.11%, closing on December 17, 2021, at $18 per share, before declining another 5.5% the next trading day. By December 22, 2021, Cognyte’s stock had fallen to trade at $15 per share, representing a decline of nearly 21%.  Then, on April 5, 2022, Cognyte issued its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the period ended January 31, 2022 (the “2021 Annual Report”), revealing that the Company was forced to modify its solutions in response to the Threat Report, stating in relevant part:  Our solutions capture, fuse and analyze data collected from various sources, including from commercial web sources and social platforms. Such sources and platforms may allege that our solutions and techniques for capturing and collecting data and information from such sources violate their terms of use or other propriety rights of such sources or of their users. In December 2021, Meta Platforms Inc., or Meta, issued a report alleging that certain solutions offered by us that interface with Facebook and Instagram platforms violate their terms of use. Concurrently with the issuance of the foregoing report, Meta announced that it had removed accounts that it claimed were associated with our solutions and requested we cease data collection from its social platforms. In response to Meta’s allegations, we made modifications to certain features of our solutions, which impacted the manner our customers can use these solutions. Any allegations that our solutions and techniques infringe the terms of use or rights of third parties may result in legal claims against us or our customers. These claims may damage our reputation, adversely impact our customer relationships and create liability for us.  On the same day it published its 2021 Annual Report, Cognyte reported its fourth quarter 2021 financial results, representing the period during which Facebook disrupted and disabled Cognyte’s use of its platforms for purposes of reconnaissance. Cognyte badly missed analyst consensus estimates for non-GAAP earnings per share and sales, and significantly undershot the midpoint of its guidance range by several millions of dollars, citing in the Company’s accompanying press release “lower conversions within [its] product pipeline,” among other macroenvironmental challenges. Specifically, the Company’s non-GAAP earnings of $0.16 per share were not only down significantly from the $0.36 per share it earned in the year-ago quarter but also $0.06 per share below analysts’ expectations of $0.22 per share. Similarly, Cognyte’s sales of $124.9 million, representing a less than 1% increase from the year-ago period, also came significantly below analysts’ consensus estimate of $129.6 million.  The response from analysts was swift with many reducing their price targets, including Wedbush, who lowered their price target from $17 to $9 and concluded: [T]he Cognyte business model is turning into a debacle of [ ] epic proportions for investors that once believed in the story. Since the spin-off from Verint over the past year, the Cognyte story ha[s] been a nightmare for investors as the execution shortfalls, longer sales cycles, and myriad of challenges has created a perfect storm for the Street. Most troubling to us is that CGNT was unable to guide for 1Q23 and 2023, which means to us that management may not have their arms around the sales execution and headwinds in our opinion.  The market also responded immediately and harshly. Cognyte’s stock price plummeted over 31% on unusually high trading volume, closing at $8.03 per share on April 5, 2022, which was down $3.63 per share from its April 4, 2022 close of $11.66 per share.  Then, on June 28, 2022, Cognyte released its first quarter 2022 financial results, which, once again, badly missed analyst estimates across the board. Cognyte’s 1Q22 revenue of $87 million, for example, represented a decline of 25%. Analysts were expecting a decline of 2%.  In response, analysts immediately downgraded the Company’s rating and reduced their price targets. William Blair, for example, downgraded Cognyte to “market perform” and concluded that Cognyte’s “low pipeline conversion” issues were a symptom of a broader problem, stating in relevant part:  Cognyte’s brand has been negatively impacted by increased scrutiny of the cyber intelligence industry and fellow Israel cyber surveillance firm NSO Group. Last fall, the U.S. government blacklisted the NSO Group after a multitude of reports surfaced that its software was being used inappropriately by governments to spy on citizens with dissenting views. While we believe there is value to cyber intelligence we believe that it is important for investors and customers that there are rigid safeguards in place and high transparency to ensure that the software is used in an ethical manner.  On this news, Cognyte’s shares declined $1.84, or over 28.66%, to close at $4.58 per share.

    "content": "Las Vegas, NV., April  17, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Titan Lithium Inc., (OTC Markets: CDSG) (the “Company” or “CDSG”) is pleased to provide a corporate update.  As of April 17th, 2023, the Company has now completed 2 years of PCAOB qualified year end financial statements. Subsequent to the filing of these audited statements, CDSG will be filing a Registration Statement on Form 10 (“Form 10”) before the end of this month with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register its common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the 1934 Act). The Form 10 filing provides information on the company’s strategy and its historical financial data. Upon its effectiveness, the Company will be subject to the reporting requirements of the 1934 Act, which will include quarterly, annual and current reports, as well as proxy statements, to be filed with the SEC.  \"We are confident our proposed registration with the SEC will provide a number of benefits to the Company and its shareholders, including increased visibility, enhanced access to the capital markets, and deeper liquidity for its stock,\" said Harp Sangha, Chairman of CDSG. “We believe we have discovered some truly massive Lithium resources and optimizing corporate effectiveness will allow us to help further these exceptional battery-metal projects.”   Mr. Sangha added “This has been a very active year for the Company and for Tanzania’s critical mineral industry. On a recent visit by the U.S. Vice President, it was made clear that the U.S. and Western governments are challenging China’s dominance in the African continent for battery metals. As well, in the month of February, Tesla signed an agreement under which it will purchase between 17,500 to 35,000 tonnes per annum of Anode Active Material (AAM) from Tanzania.”  About the Company: China Dongsheng International Inc. (OTC Markets: CDSG), through its wholly owned subsidiary Titan Lithium, Inc., is a lithium explorer and developer with operations in Nevada, USA and The United Republic of Tanzania.

Organic sales significantly outperformed worldwide automotive production growth, boosted by a favorable geographic mix effect and an additional month of consolidation of HELLA.    We remain focused on our three drivers: generate solid sales growth driven by innovation and sustainability; lower the cost base and breakeven point of operations; enhance cash conversion and close the announced divestments to accelerate Group deleveraging, our top priority.”\n   The Board of Directors, under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN, met on April 14, 2023 and, during this meeting, reviewed the present Press Release.All definitions are explained at the end of this Press Release, under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.IFRS 5 - Discontinued operations   Faurecia’s SAS Cockpit Modules division (assembly and logistics services), whose contemplated disposal was announced on February 19, 2023, is now presented as Discontinued operations with the following impact on the Group’s 2022 consolidated quarterly sales figures:\n All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility (ex-IHS Markit) forecast dated March 2023.\n   Q1 2023 GROUP SALES\n In Q1 2023, FORVIA’s consolidated sales grew by 29.0% to €6,644 million, of which:   A very limited negative currency effect of €30 million or -0.6% of last year’s sales; the negative year-on-year effect of the Chinese yuan, the British pound and Turkish lira vs. the euro more than offset the positive effect from the US dollar vs. the euroA scope effect of €617 million or +12.0% of last year’s sales, due to one month of additional consolidation of HELLA (whose consolidation in the Group’s accounts started on February 1, 2022)Organic growth of €908 million or +17.6% of last year’s sales.    Organic growth of +17.6% compares with +2.7% growth in worldwide automotive production over the same period, i.e. an outperformance of 1,490 basis points.   This outperformance of 1,490 basis points includes a favorable geographic mix estimated at c. 400 basis points and a positive impact related to inflation pass-through to customers estimated at c. 240 basis points.\n   SALES BY BUSINESS GROUP\nSEATING (31% of Q1 2023 Group consolidated sales)   Organic growth of +22.5% in the quarter mainly reflected organic growth in Europe and China:   In Europe: mainly with VW, Stellantis, RNM, Daimler and BMWIn China: mostly with Chinese OEMs (notably BYD).

As mentioned above, in the calculation of Net debt / Adjusted EBITDA at December 31, 2022, adjusted EBITDA was taken into account over the last 12 month-period; as HELLA has been consolidated only since February 1, 2022 (11 months), one additional month of contribution from HELLA has been taken into account for the calculation of the ratio.All other definitions are explained at the end of this Press Release, under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility (ex-IHS Markit) forecast dated February 2023.\nDISCLAIMER    This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements concerning Faurecia.

As “Scope effect”, Faurecia presents all acquisitions/divestments, whose sales on an annual basis amount to more than €250 million.   Other acquisitions below this threshold are considered as “bolt-on acquisitions” and are included in “Growth at constant currencies”.   In 2021, there was no effect from “bolt-on acquisitions”; as a result, “Growth at constant currencies” is equivalent to sales growth at constant scope and currencies also presented as organic growth.

It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:   Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations;Other non-recurring operating income and expense, corresponding to material, unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs, the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business, the closure or sale of an industrial site, disposals of non-operating buildings, impairment losses recorded for property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, as well as other material and unusual losses;Income on loans, cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs;Other financial income and expense, which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets, the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges, changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9, and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries;Taxes.   Adjusted EBITDA   Adjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation, this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1, 2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).   Net cash-flow   Net cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents), other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets.

Our masterplan has set a clear pathway to achieve that mission: the transformation of cost-intensive small-series products to cheaper mass-series vehicles,\" Tesla said in a statement.\nIn Germany, Tesla has lowered the price of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles by between 4.5 percent and 9.8 percent, data on its website showed on Friday, marking its second price reduction this year after price cuts of up to 17 percent in January.\nIn France, customers buying the Model 3 for 44,990 euros ($47,860.36) will now get a further price reduction through a government subsidy of 5,000 euros. The upper limit for the EV scheme is 47,000 euros.\nOn April 2, the EV maker posted record quarterly deliveries of 422,875 vehicles January to March after cutting prices of its cars globally, but quarter-on-quarter sales growth was modest because of rising competition and a bleak economic outlook.\nCEO Elon Musk said Tesla would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand and that it had seen success in sparking orders with January's discounts.\nIn the U.S., Tesla has cut the price of its base Model 3 by a cumulative 11 percent since the start of the year, with a 20 percent reduction on its base Model Y.\nRelated Article\nTesla will be notably missing from Shanghai auto show",

    "title": "Varnish Software Unveils Massive Storage Engine 4 for Improved Availability, Reduced Latency and Bolstered Resilience at the Edge",
    "authors": [
      "Robert Brownlie"
    ],
    "content": "Varnish Software, a leader in caching, streaming and content delivery software solutions, today unveiled Massive Storage Engine (MSE) 4, its newest and most advanced solution for storing and managing cached objects and their metadata, and the latest addition to Varnish Enterprise 6.\nMSE 4 further improves availability, reduces latency and ensures customers can always deliver the optimal digital experiences, under high loads or even when certain drives fail. It’s ideal for video distribution and large-cache use cases, as it adds persistence and resilience to content delivery internally, externally, and at the Edge.\nThese new features and capabilities complement recent enhancements to Varnish’s growing portfolio of Content Delivery Software solutions.\n“Content delivery use cases are rapidly evolving, and we are seeing that live streaming and VOD are the highest growth segments,” said Adrian Herrera, CMO, Varnish Software. “The challenge for content providers, telcos and even traditional CDNs is how to support this growth and deliver the best digital experience in an economical way. A large part of this is having the ability to store, access and deliver content as efficiently and reliably as possible, even in the face of hardware failures and traffic spikes, which is what MSE 4 enables.”\nVarnish Software’s MSE 3 already offered high-performance caching and persistence for 100TB+ data sets. MSE 4 builds on this foundation, making storage more efficient and reducing wear and tear on drives. The latest enhancements significantly improve speeds when managing metadata, often cutting the input/output operations per second by half. Additionally, new updates to dynamic configuration processes, content integrity checks and disk error handling can prevent and mitigate the impacts of downtime for cached content, leading to greater resilience and less end-user disruption.\nMSE 4 integrates seamlessly with Varnish Enterprise 6, Varnish Software’s feature-rich web cache and HTTP accelerator, and further expands on its many unique capabilities and benefits, including the newly upgraded Varnish Controller 5.1.\nVarnish Controller 5.1 provides advanced tools for robust traffic routing and load balancing to ensure content is always delivered from the optimal location. The recent updates include a streamlined UI, which provides value from day one; and a suite of new tools to customize, modify and manage custom routing to support the needs of virtually any configuration. \nIn addition to MSE 4 and Controller 5.1, Varnish Software recently announced record-breaking benchmarks for content delivery performance, power and TCO efficiency. All advancements enhance Varnish’s Content Delivery Software stack which can be deployed to any location, at the edge or elsewhere, and are optimized for video on demand (VOD) and live streaming content delivery.\n“Edge is rapidly becoming essential to delivering the optimal video experiences. The only way to support this in a sustainable way is by disaggregating content delivery from the underlying infrastructure to extend the useful life and ROI of existing hardware, ensure you get the most value from new hardware investments and move content delivery as close to the point of consumption to improve QoS,” added Herrera.\nThe edge computing market will generate $178 billion by 2026, per STL Partners, with edge content delivery contributing to 18% of total addressable revenue. \nTo learn more about Varnish Software’s latest content delivery solutions, and how to deliver responsive and resilient digital experiences from origin to edge, please schedule a meeting with Varnish Software at their booth - West Hall #W3501 - during NAB 2023 here.\nAbout Varnish Software\r\nVarnish Software is the leading caching, streaming and content delivery software stack.

    "authors": [

    ],
    "content": "COLMAR, Pa., April  12, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dorman Products, Inc. (NASDAQ:DORM) announced today the release of 250 new motor vehicle parts, including 75 aftermarket exclusives. The new products advance Dorman’s mission of providing repair professionals and owners greater freedom to fix motor vehicles with a comprehensive range of powertrains, while also creating new revenue and profit opportunities for retailers and distributors.    This month’s new releases include a first-to-the-aftermarket intake manifold runner control (IMRC) motor and arm (911-929) designed to fit more than half a million 2018-2020 Chevrolet Cruze and Sonic cars on the road today. When certain models equipped with 1.8L ECOTEC engines generate a P2076 error code, it's commonly the result of the factory tuning arm breaking, disconnecting from, and disabling the IMRC valve assembly. Over time and miles, the factory-design arm's plastic ball can wear, causing the IMRC motor to fail. The dealer's repair solution typically requires the purchase of a costly intake manifold assembly that includes the motor, arm, manifold, fuel rail, and injectors. That replacement utilizes the same design in the IMRC motor arm setup, inviting a similar failure down the road. The new Dorman® OE FIX™ IMRC assembly with upgraded tuning arm saves money and repair time by allowing the replacement of just the motor assembly. The improved tuning arm design is made of brass to help provide increased service life and reduce future related repair costs.    Dorman is also reinforcing its position as a leading manufacturer of upgraded engine hoses designed to eliminate the OE plastic connectors that are the most common failure point of that part category. The newest Dorman OE FIX engine coolant reservoir hose (626-749) features an aluminum connector to increase reliability, rather than the factory version’s plastic connector, which tends to crack and leak over time. The new hose is engineered to replace failure-prone hoses on 2017-2019 Ford F-250 through F-450 trucks equipped with 6.7L diesel engines that are often used in applications where downtime is not an option, including first-response emergency vehicles. It joins two other additions to Dorman’s comprehensive line of heater hose assemblies (626-675 and 626-696), designed to match the fit and function of the original equipment hoses on a combined 2.5 million Ford and General Motors vehicles.    This month’s new releases include two more additions to Dorman’s rapidly expanding array of components and accessories for turbochargers. The Dorman catalog already includes hundreds of turbo-related parts covering millions of repair opportunities. A new turbo oil supply line (667-524) and a convenient turbo line replacement kit (667-026) are being introduced that are engineered to fit almost 3 million General Motors cars, trucks, and SUVs. The supply line and the replacement kit include new bolts and gaskets required to make complete, reliable repairs.    Other new product highlights for April 2023 include:    Two new OE FIX control arms for Tesla 3 and Y models (527-513 and 527-514), designed to replace the original plastic design with a stronger steel ball joint housing with a stamped steel arm attached by sturdy rivets. To help prevent damaging corrosion and moisture intrusion, the arms are also electrostatically coated, and the ball joint is protected by a completely sealed housing. (Watch Dorman’s new video on these products here.)An active grille shutter (601-362) designed to replace the original shutter installed on 1.7+ million 2018-2020 Ford F-150 trucks. This newest addition to Dorman’s expanding line of active grille shutters is CAPA-certified, meaning it meets the stringent quality standards of the Certified Automotive Parts Association for use in collision repairs.A nitrogen oxide (NOx) sensor (904-6018) for certain 2017-2020 Ford Super Duty trucks, a necessity for meeting emissions regulations. The new NOx sensor is precisely engineered and manufactured to match the fit and function of the original equipment sensor, which, based on demand, may be difficult to source from the OE dealer network.A 4WD front differential housing (600-211) designed to match the fit and function of the original equipment housing installed on 7 million Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC trucks and SUVs.    These are just a few of Dorman’s 250 featured new product releases this month, which include replacement components and assemblies for passenger and commercial vehicles of every type and powertrain.

    "title": "EV startup Polestar braces for two product launches in less than a year",
    "content": "CEO Thomas Ingenlath attends a celebration this week for the Polestar 3 in Los Angeles.\nLOS ANGELES — Electric vehicle maker Polestar is witnessing the downside of the \"asset-light\" strategy that is key to its rapid growth plan.\nTo operate fast and easy, Polestar is reliant on global partners to help produce its models. But when those partners can't deliver according to plan, Polestar's strategy can kneecap its growth.\nThat is what is happening to the Swedish startup.\nPolestar is part of a portfolio of brands controlled by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, which includes Volvo Cars, Lynk & Co and Lotus. The Chinese conglomerate's network of global factories, supplier networks and R&D centers allow the young brand to focus on product and technology rather than manufacturing or logistics, according to the plan.\n \nBut software-related hiccups in the development of Volvo's new SPA2 vehicle platform could complicate Polestar's ambitions to expand in the U.S. market.\nThe Polestar 3 midsize crossover, based on the SPA2 architecture, has been delayed by nearly a year, causing a cascading effect on Polestar's commercial strategy. The fledgling brand suddenly finds itself juggling back-to-back product rollouts.\nThe Polestar 3 is now expected in U.S. stores in the fourth quarter, and only about nine months later comes the coupe-style Polestar 4 crossover.\n\"When everybody is scared of one launch, how can we launch two cars from an industrial point of view?\" wondered CEO Thomas Ingenlath in an interview with Automotive News on the sidelines of a Polestar 3 event here.\n \nScaling fast\nPolestar's predicament illustrates the downside of reliance on others for product development and manufacturing.\nThe delay of Polestar's first crossover and a critical U.S. model is hurting its retailers' bottom lines.\nWith just one model to sell, dealers say they don't have throughput to justify their investment in high-rent shopping center stores.\n\"A year earlier or later makes a difference in the marketplace where competitors are developing cars,\" said Ingenlath, a lanky German designer with a penchant for tailored suits and turtlenecks.\nWhile Polestar can't fully control its destiny with the collaborative model, Ingenlath said it's still a more pragmatic approach for rapidly scaling up. By about mid-decade, Polestar will flesh out its model lineup with crossovers, a large sedan and a roadster.\n\"We would be in a completely different situation,\" Ingenlath said, if Polestar had instead decided to build its cars from scratch.\nThe CEO points to Tesla, the only automotive startup in recent history to achieve market scale, as an example of how long the go-it-alone strategy would take Polestar.\n\"Tesla has been doing this now for over a decade,\" Ingenlath said. \"That definitely takes a long, long time.\"\nRelated Article\nPolestar leasing gets a lift from new U.S. EV tax credit\nMultiple launches\nThe back-to-back launches that are coming will undoubtedly strain Polestar's marketing and commercial teams, but Ingenlath does not expect much sales cannibalization. The two models \"are very different in what they represent and what they do,\" he said.\nHe described the Porsche Cayenne-size, high-riding Polestar 3 as more of a \"true SUV.\"\nIn contrast, the sportier Polestar 4 is more of a \"four-door GT but with a little bit elevated position.\"\nModel pricing will also create differentiation.\nThe Polestar 3, starting at $85,300 including shipping, aims at the upper end of the premium crossover segment, while the Polestar 4 is more affordable luxury.\n\"A car from $60,000 reaches a completely different target audience than a car in the $80,000 range,\" Ingenath said.\nCharleston-made\nPolestar's crossovers will be built at Volvo and Geely plants.\nThe Polestar 3 will be the brand's first U.S.-built model, with production at Volvo's 2.3-million-square-foot factory, an hour northwest of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\"Charleston is super important\" for Polestar's ambitions in the U.S., Ingenlath said. The assembly plant will supply the global output of Polestar 3, except for China.\nDomestic production is good from an economic point of view but also psychologically, Ingenlath said.\n\"It's such a strong signal for the U.S. market that we come here and produce a car that we sell here — and export the car from the U.S.,\" he said.\nDue to its sticker price, the dual-motor Polestar 3 will not initially qualify for federal EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act despite domestic production. But a new single-motor variant that should arrive in the second half of 2024 will be priced below the $80,000 threshold to claim the federal tax incentives of up to $7,500.\nRelated Article\nPolestar to drop $20 million in Q2 to market its first crossover\nWeighing options\nThe Polestar 4, based on Geely's SEA platform, faces a hefty 27.5 percent U.S. tariff levied on Chinese imports, putting a wrinkle in the model's mass-market aspirations.\nIngenlath said the company is \"evaluating\" manufacturing options outside China.\nThe Geely group's global production network is \"something we can leverage,\" the CEO said. \"If there is an attractive and economically feasible solution, we will consider bringing [Polestar 4 production] somewhere else.\"\nBut locating Polestar 4 production stateside is unlikely because Geely would need a factory and supplier network here.\nIngenlath said it is \"impossible\" to build every model in the portfolio in every region in which they sell.\nThe Polestar 4 could also benefit from a U.S. trade agreement that allows the automaker to offset import tariffs with the export of U.S.-made models.\n\"The cars that we produce that we export help us to import the cars that we don't produce here,\" Ingenlath said.",

    "content": "A HighTech-Solutions (HTS) study*, commissioned by the international, non-profit patent licensing platform LOT Network, analyzed the 6,161 lawsuits filed by non-practicing entities (NPEs) from 2017 through 2022. The analysis identified several key findings. \nFirst, the study found that companies who are preparing for or have just announced an IPO are at a greater risk of being sued by a non-practicing entity (NPE) than other businesses. HTS identified and analyzed 247 companies, among the overall universe of NPE targeted firms, that went public during the period 2012 – 2022, and found 36.9 percent experienced one or more cases of NPE litigation between two years prior to and two years after an IPO. \nHTS also found that the most attractive NPE targets were companies that had multiple fundraising rounds, raising at least a Series C round. There is an indication that a most recent funding round of $50 million or more makes a potential target even more attractive to NPEs. While large companies with an annual revenue of $1 billion or more represent 21% of the companies sued, more than 52 percent of companies targeted during 2017 – 2022 had an annual revenue of less than $25 million. Companies of all sizes and industries are at risk of finding themselves targeted by NPEs in today’s environment. \n“When companies anticipate an exit, whether it be IPO or acquisition, they are at a heightened risk for lawsuits filed by NPEs,” said Patrick McBride, Senior Director & Assistant General Counsel for Intellectual Property at Red Hat. “Investors and their legal teams consider the risks associated with a business before striking deals, and possible litigation by an NPE can be a showstopper for an exit event. Smart leaders will look for ways to mitigate their risk. With the average cost to defend an NPE lawsuit hovering around $4 million, there is a clear benefit to taking protective measures, like joining a defensive community such as LOT Network, to reduce exposure.” \n“We found that more than 61 percent of the companies that were targeted by NPEs during the 2017 – 2022 period (over 3,573 firms) had no patents of their own,” said Jeff Carter, CEO of HighTech-Solutions. “Many small companies have a false sense of security that only large companies can be targets of NPE suits. The truth is that companies of any size need to be proactive in developing a comprehensive IP strategy.” Another 12 percent of companies sued hold fewer than 10 patent families. \nHTS also found that the companies most frequently targeted by NPE lawsuits operate in these top industries as defined by their SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) code:\r\n\nManufacturing\nBusiness Services\nRetail Trade\nFinance, Insurance, and Real Estate\nTransportation, Communications, Electric, Gas, and Sanitary Services\nWholesale Trade\nPublic Administration\nConstruction\nMining\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fishing\n\nLOT Network is a non-profit organization and is the most cost-effective way to protect against unwanted NPE litigation. For companies earning less than $25 million, LOT Network offers a free, subsidized membership. All LOT Network members agree that if any member’s patent assets fall into the hands of a patent assertion entity (PAE), the company provides a license to all other network members, thereby immunizing the 2,800+ members of LOT Network against PAE litigation from those assets. At the same time, traditional uses of patents are unaffected: members are still free to sell or transfer their patents, participate in patent pools, license them for revenue, or assert them. LOT Network is purely defensive immunization against costly PAE litigation. \nTo download the full report, visit: \nAbout HTS \r\nHTS is a select team of experienced and credentialed licensing, technical, financial and business executives.

    "content": "DUBLIN, April 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The \"Strategic Analysis of WBG Semiconductors in Power Electronics Applications for EVs, Forecast to 2030\" report has been added to \n ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\nThe increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide boosts power semiconductor demand. Government laws and subsidies, original equipment manufacturers' (OEMs') dedication to net zero emissions, and sustainability goals accelerate EV penetration in the vehicle industry. This study focuses on wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors for the North American EV market.\nSilicon carbide (SiC) and gallium-nitride (GaN) are the 2 WBG technologies that overcome the limitations of silicon in EVs. The semiconductor content of an EV is 2 to 3 times higher than conventional ICE, and almost 75% of this comes from power semiconductors.\nThe author estimates the EV market will continue double-digit growth until the decade's end. The WBG semiconductor market is sizable, expanding, and highly fragmented, providing a significant opportunity for new competitors. High-voltage, high-performance power semiconductors will continue to be vital for EVs and a growing part of the semiconductor segment in the forecast period.\nThe study aims to understand the impact of new regional policies, Chips Act 2022, highlights drivers and restraints, performance differences of WBG semiconductor materials, patent landscape, and key vendors in the ecosystem. The automotive EV components covered are main inverters, onboard chargers, and DC-DC converters. Based on the analysis, WBG semiconductor content will rise 2 times in EVs, from 2026 to 2027, due to OEM adoption of 800 V electrical architecture.\nThis report provides an outlook on the WBG semiconductor device market for EVs, focusing on North American automotive OEM demand. The key North American OEMs identified are Tesla, GM, Ford, Lucid, and Rivian, adopting WBG or compound semiconductor technology.

(NYSE: CTLT)  Class Period: August 30, 2021 - October 31, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 25, 2023  This case is about the rise and fall of a company that initially benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic (also referred to herein as “COVID-19,” “COVID,” or the “pandemic”). As a vaccine manufacturer, Catalent was one of the beneficiaries of COVID because it seemed well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for vaccine production capacity. Indeed, Catalent almost doubled its business during the first year of the pandemic when the bulk of vaccines were administered. Catalent’s success during the early stages of the pandemic caused its stock price to soar to record highs. By mid-2021, when COVID-related work dropped off, Defendants engaged in accounting and channel stuffing schemes to pad the Company’s revenues. These schemes gave Catalent the appearance of continued growth, causing its stock price to reach new record highs. Meanwhile, to support these schemes and keep pace with its lofty growth targets, Catalent was cutting corners on safety and control procedures at key production facilities. By late 2022, Catalent reported significant sales declines and excess inventory throughout its supply chain. As a result, Catalent stock dropped to pre-COVID levels causing substantial losses to its investors as they learned that Catalent’s early-COVID revenues were never sustainable, and its Class Period revenues were the product of securities fraud.  By way of background, Catalent is a multinational corporation that manufactures and packages drugs into delivery devices fit for human consumption (i.e., pre-filled syringes, vials, pills, etc.) pursuant to long-term supply contracts with pharmaceutical companies. Catalent directly sells these products to pharmaceutical companies which later sell them through the supply chain to healthcare providers (i.e., hospitals, clinics, etc.), which administer them to patients, who are the end consumers.   Prior to the onset of the pandemic, Catalent’s quarterly revenue averaged approximately $669 million between April 2018 and March 2020. During the period that those revenues were reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of approximately $47.57 per share. In early 2020, Catalent took on numerous large-scale COVID projects, including filling vaccines into syringes for Moderna and AstraZeneca. Those projects catapulted the Company’s quarterly revenues to record highs, which averaged approximately $940 million between April 2020 and March 2021, a 40 percent jump over preCOVID revenues. Over the period when that revenue surge was reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of $102.42 per share.  By mid-2021, as the pandemic wore on, demand for Catalent’s COVID products decreased because vaccinations had already been administered to a large number of potential patients. For example, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) data indicates that COVID vaccinations in the United States reached an all-time high of 4.5 million doses on April 1, 2021, and averaged 1.5 million daily doses between December 14, 2020 and August 28, 2021. By comparison, CDC data indicates that average daily vaccinations in the United States were under 625,000 during the Class Period.  Despite this marked decline in the demand for COVID vaccines, Catalent continued to report growing revenues and assured investors that customer demand remained strong during the Class Period. The average quarterly revenue reported during the Class Period was $1.2 billion, an 80 percent increase over preCOVID-19 revenues and a 28 percent increase over its reported revenues for the first year of the pandemic. Unbeknownst to investors, Defendants artificially inflated these revenues through fraudulent accounting and channel stuffing schemes to mislead investors into believing that Catalent was generating sustainable revenue growth. Defendants’ fraud caused Catalent stock to trade at a record high of $142.64 per share on September 9, 2021 and an average closing price of approximately $108.00 per share during the Class Period.  Statements made by Defendants throughout the Class Period were materially false and misleading when made because they misrepresented or failed to disclose the following adverse facts, which were known to Defendants or recklessly disregarded by them:  a. Catalent materially overstated its revenue and earnings by prematurely recognizing revenue in violation of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”);  b. Catalent had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to revenue recognition;  c. Catalent falsely represented demand for its products while it knowingly sold more product to its direct customers than could be sold to healthcare providers and end consumers;  d. Catalent disregarded regulatory rules at key production facilities in order to rapidly produce excess inventory that was used to pad the Company’s financial results through premature revenue recognition in violation of GAAP and/or stuffing its direct customers with this excess inventory; and  e. As a result of the foregoing, Defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company’s financial performance, outlook, and regulatory compliance during the Class Period.  Catalent’s misrepresentations were first revealed to the market on August 29, 2022, when the Company disclosed that demand for its COVID-related products was facing substantial headwinds. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 7.4 percent to close at $92.28 per share on August 29, 2022.  Then, on September 20, 2022, a Washington Post report exposed that the release of COVID-19 vaccines produced by Catalent had been delayed by regulators because of improper sterilization at one of Catalent’s key facilities. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 9.3 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $79.06 per share on September 22, 2022.  On November 1, 2022, Catalent revealed that its quarterly earnings had declined to zero and lowered its financial guidance, indicating falling demand. The Company also disclosed that regulatory issues at its key facilities were negatively impacting its financial results. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 31.7 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $44.90 per share on November 2, 2022. All told, over the course of the Class period, Catalent stock fell from a high above $142.00 to close at $44.90 on November 2, 2022, a more than 68 percent decline.  On November 16, 2022, Catalent revealed that it was carrying approximately $400 million in excess inventory, further revealing that the Company had misrepresented demand for its products as well as its purported ability to predict future demand. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 8.5 percent, over two trading sessions, to close at $42.07 per share on November 17, 2022.  Then, on December 8, 2022, GlassHouse Research published a report claiming that Catalent had been materially overstating its revenues by $568.2 million in violation of GAAP. The report detailed numerous red flags that were indicative of Catalent’s improper accounting practices. These red flags included the rapid increase in Catalent’s contract asset and inventory balances, declining customer deposits, executive turnover, and recent scrutiny of the Company’s revenue accounting by regulators. The report also described how Catalent’s direct customers were stuffed with excess inventory which “will take years to unwind.” On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined 3.6 percent to close at $45.54 per share on December 8, 2022.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of Catalent securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

(NASDAQ: TSLA)  Class Period: February 19, 2019 - February 17, 2023  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2023  Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles, battery energy storage, solar panels and roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is headquartered in Austin, Texas and incorporated in Delaware. The Company’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “TSLA”.  In 2014, Tesla announced Tesla Autopilot (“Autopilot”), a suite of purportedly advanced driver-assistance system (“ADAS”) features including automated lane-centering, traffic-aware cruise control, lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation, and self-parking. In September 2014, all Tesla cars started shipping with the sensors and software necessary to support the Autopilot system. Since then, the Company has touted refinements and enhancements to the Company’s ADAS and Autopilot features, including so-called “Full Self-Driving” (“FSD”) software, which purportedly enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system.  Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants had significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company’s Autopilot and FSD technologies; (ii) contrary to Defendants’ representations, Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury associated with the operation of Tesla vehicles; (iii) all the foregoing subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm; and (iv) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.  On April 18, 2021, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle with “no one” driving it had crashed into a tree, killing two passengers near Houston, Texas in a “fiery” crash. A Harris County Precinct constable told local news station KPRC 2 that the investigation showed “no one was driving” the 2019 Tesla vehicle when the accident occurred.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $25.15 per share, or 3.4%, to close at $714.63 per share on April 19, 2021.  On August 16, 2021, media outlets reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) had opened a formal investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles. The scope of the investigation included 765,000 vehicles, or nearly every vehicle that Tesla has sold in the U.S. since the start of the 2014 model year.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $31.00 per share, or 4.32%, to close at $686.17 per share on August 16, 2021.  On June 3, 2022, media outlets reported that NHTSA had issued a formal inquiry to Tesla about the Autopilot and FSD features for certain models of its vehicles after receiving complaints from more than 750 owners of the vehicles about sudden and unexpected braking with no immediate cause.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $71.45 per share, or 9.22%, to close at $703.55 per share on June 3, 2022.  On January 27, 2023, media outlets reported that the SEC was investigating statements made by Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Defendant Elon R. Musk (“Musk”), concerning the Autopilot system, including whether Musk made inappropriate forward-looking statements regarding the Autopilot system.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $11.24 per share, or 6.32%, to close at $166.66 per share on January 30, 2023.  On February 16, 2023, media outlets reported that NHTSA had ordered a recall of nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the Company’s FSD “Beta” software, stating that the software may allow the equipped vehicles to act “in an unlawful or unpredictable manner,” increasing the risk of a crash.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $12.20 per share, or 5.69%, to close at $202.04 per share on February 16, 2023.  Then, on February 18, 2023, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle had crashed into a fire truck that was responding to an earlier accident, killing the driver and injuring a passenger and four firefighters. News reports linked the crash with prior reports of Tesla vehicles crashing into stationary emergency vehicles as a consequence of poorly performing ADAS technologies, increasing market and public concerns regarding the Autopilot system in Tesla’s vehicles.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $10.94 per share, or 5.25%, to close at $197.37 per share on February 21, 2023, the next trading day.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common stock, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.  For more information on the Tesla class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TSLA  DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO)  Class Period: In connection with the June 2021 IPO  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023  DLocal, which conducted its IPO in New York and trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “DLO,” connects global merchants to emerging markets, earning revenues from fees charged to merchants in connection with payment processing services for cross-border and local payment transactions.  In June 2021, Defendants (defined below) commenced DLocal’s IPO, issuing over 33.8 million shares at $21.00 per share, including the full exercise of the Underwriter Defendants’ (defined herein) option to purchase additional shares, all pursuant to the Registration Statement.  Among other things, the Registration Statement repeatedly touts DLocal’s supposed “growing and deepening relationships” with new and existing global merchant clients. The Registration Statement tells prospective investors that DLocal measures its success by means of its “cohort” performance in terms of TPV, or total payment volume, and offers historic TPV data to support the narrative that DLocal has a strong track record. In addition, the Registration Statement advises prospective investors that a remediation plan designed to improve the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting is being implemented, assuring the market that DLocal is serious about its internal controls over financial reporting.  The Registration Statement’s numerous representations about DLocal’s TPV and its internal controls over financial reporting, however, contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state material facts both required by governing regulations and necessary to make the statements made not misleading. Specifically, the Registration Statement misrepresents the TPV derived from new merchants in DLocal’s 2019 and 2020 cohorts, which, at the time of the IPO, were severely lower than what the Registration Statement reported, as well as the fact that the remediation plan DLocal implemented before the IPO was patently defective and, thus, incapable of improving the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.  When the truth regarding the Company’s TPV and internal controls reached the market, DLocal’s common stock cratered over 50%. All told, investors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.

(NASDAQ: CGNT)  Class Period: February 2, 2021 - June 28, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023  On December 16, 2021, after the market closed, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, issued a “Threat Report,” which included the results of its “months long” investigation into the “surveillance-for-hire industry,” revealing for the first time that Cognyte (along with six private companies) regularly targeted, without their knowledge, journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists around the world, and collected intelligence on these people by manipulating them to reveal information and/or by compromising their devices and accounts, in violation of Facebook’s “multiple community standards and Terms of Service.” In particular, the Threat Report revealed that Cognyte “sells access to its platform which enables managing fake accounts across social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and VKontakte (VK), and other websites to social-engineer people and collect data.” This conduct “violated multiple Community Standards and Terms of Service,” and “given the severity of their violations,” Meta disabled Cognyte’s ability to use its platforms (removing about 100 accounts on Facebook and Instagram), shared its findings with security researchers, other platforms, and policymakers, issued Cease and Desist warnings, and alerted the nearly 50,000 individuals (across 100 countries) who were believed to be targeted to help them strengthen the security of their accounts.  On this news, the price of Cognyte’s common stock fell 5.11%, closing on December 17, 2021, at $18 per share, before declining another 5.5% the next trading day. By December 22, 2021, Cognyte’s stock had fallen to trade at $15 per share, representing a decline of nearly 21%.  Then, on April 5, 2022, Cognyte issued its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the period ended January 31, 2022 (the “2021 Annual Report”), revealing that the Company was forced to modify its solutions in response to the Threat Report, stating in relevant part:  Our solutions capture, fuse and analyze data collected from various sources, including from commercial web sources and social platforms. Such sources and platforms may allege that our solutions and techniques for capturing and collecting data and information from such sources violate their terms of use or other propriety rights of such sources or of their users. In December 2021, Meta Platforms Inc., or Meta, issued a report alleging that certain solutions offered by us that interface with Facebook and Instagram platforms violate their terms of use. Concurrently with the issuance of the foregoing report, Meta announced that it had removed accounts that it claimed were associated with our solutions and requested we cease data collection from its social platforms. In response to Meta’s allegations, we made modifications to certain features of our solutions, which impacted the manner our customers can use these solutions. Any allegations that our solutions and techniques infringe the terms of use or rights of third parties may result in legal claims against us or our customers. These claims may damage our reputation, adversely impact our customer relationships and create liability for us.  On the same day it published its 2021 Annual Report, Cognyte reported its fourth quarter 2021 financial results, representing the period during which Facebook disrupted and disabled Cognyte’s use of its platforms for purposes of reconnaissance. Cognyte badly missed analyst consensus estimates for non-GAAP earnings per share and sales, and significantly undershot the midpoint of its guidance range by several millions of dollars, citing in the Company’s accompanying press release “lower conversions within [its] product pipeline,” among other macroenvironmental challenges. Specifically, the Company’s non-GAAP earnings of $0.16 per share were not only down significantly from the $0.36 per share it earned in the year-ago quarter but also $0.06 per share below analysts’ expectations of $0.22 per share. Similarly, Cognyte’s sales of $124.9 million, representing a less than 1% increase from the year-ago period, also came significantly below analysts’ consensus estimate of $129.6 million.  The response from analysts was swift with many reducing their price targets, including Wedbush, who lowered their price target from $17 to $9 and concluded: [T]he Cognyte business model is turning into a debacle of [ ] epic proportions for investors that once believed in the story. Since the spin-off from Verint over the past year, the Cognyte story ha[s] been a nightmare for investors as the execution shortfalls, longer sales cycles, and myriad of challenges has created a perfect storm for the Street. Most troubling to us is that CGNT was unable to guide for 1Q23 and 2023, which means to us that management may not have their arms around the sales execution and headwinds in our opinion.  The market also responded immediately and harshly. Cognyte’s stock price plummeted over 31% on unusually high trading volume, closing at $8.03 per share on April 5, 2022, which was down $3.63 per share from its April 4, 2022 close of $11.66 per share.  Then, on June 28, 2022, Cognyte released its first quarter 2022 financial results, which, once again, badly missed analyst estimates across the board. Cognyte’s 1Q22 revenue of $87 million, for example, represented a decline of 25%. Analysts were expecting a decline of 2%.  In response, analysts immediately downgraded the Company’s rating and reduced their price targets. William Blair, for example, downgraded Cognyte to “market perform” and concluded that Cognyte’s “low pipeline conversion” issues were a symptom of a broader problem, stating in relevant part:  Cognyte’s brand has been negatively impacted by increased scrutiny of the cyber intelligence industry and fellow Israel cyber surveillance firm NSO Group. Last fall, the U.S. government blacklisted the NSO Group after a multitude of reports surfaced that its software was being used inappropriately by governments to spy on citizens with dissenting views. While we believe there is value to cyber intelligence we believe that it is important for investors and customers that there are rigid safeguards in place and high transparency to ensure that the software is used in an ethical manner.  On this news, Cognyte’s shares declined $1.84, or over 28.66%, to close at $4.58 per share.

    "content": "BOSTON, March 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Circle Internet Financial, a global digital financial technology firm and the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), today announced it has joined LOT Network, a non-profit global community of companies that protects its members against Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs).\nPAEs acquire patents via third parties and try to make money through litigation against potential infringers. If a PAE acquires any patent asset that was once owned by a LOT Network member, all LOT Network members receive a license to that patent, protecting them from any potential litigation and fees. LOT Network covers more than 3.8 million patent assets from over 2,800 members across 56 countries. Circle is joining this collaborative community to reduce risk and encourage the development of products and services that bring real-world utility to the internet of value.\n\"Since our inception a decade ago, Circle and our products have been at the forefront of innovation and trust,\" said Daniel Kaleba, Assistant General Counsel, Litigation and IP, at Circle. \"Our membership with LOT Network champions the fair use of intellectual property and can protect the USDC infrastructure and ecosystem from patent exploitation, allowing us to focus on delivering internet-native financial services.\"\n\"I commend Circle for taking an important step in adding a measure of protection to their patent and IP strategy,\" said Ken Seddon, LOT Network CEO. \"Circle joins a growing number of financial technology companies as well as 12 of the largest holders of blockchain patents that are benefitting from the LOT agreement. With their membership in LOT, Circle and its customers can rest easy knowing that their funds are staying focused on producing great technology, attracting key talent and returning profits to shareholders versus being spent on draining resources that could put a company out of business.\"\nAbout Circle\nCircle is a global financial technology firm that enables businesses of all sizes to harness the power of digital currencies and public blockchains for payments, commerce and financial applications worldwide. Circle is powering always-on internet-native commerce, payments, and custody and is the issuer of USD Coin (USDC) and Euro Coin (EUROC).

    "content": "The public sale of the GoChargeTech Token has started on the bhero.com platform.Iasi, Romania, March  20, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new IoT platform, GoChargeTech, has been launched that will enable users in the future to access a network of shareable devices, including power banks and EV charging stations. The creators of the platform are looking to bootstrap and scale up the project through the GoChargeTech Token (symbol CHARGED), which has been created on the MultiversX blockchain network. The public sale of the token and the NFT franchise collection has started on the bhero.com platform.\nTalking about their project, a spokesperson for the company said, \"With the rise of electric vehicles thanks to companies like Tesla, as well as the concern over climate change, there is growing demand for sustainable energy solutions. At GoChargeTech, we take pride in being at the forefront of them. By creating reliable and accessible charging stations, we will be helping meet the pressing demand. This will make it easier than ever for electric vehicle owners to keep their vehicles charged on the go. By leveraging the power of IoT technology, we can create a more sustainable future while providing users more conveniences, so the adoption of electric cars grows rapidly.\"    Describing the vision for the project, the spokesperson continued, “People will be able to rent power banks from a network of stations owned by GoChargeTech and franchise owners. They will also be able to find an EV charger in proximity to a specified location. All they have to do is simply book a time slot and charge their car. We are using blockchain technology to enable them to pay for their services transparently. It's that simple.\"    Moreover, people will also be able to connect their EV chargers to the platform and earn passive income by sharing it with other users. They can also buy EV chargers compatible with their infrastructure and earn passive income via their platform.\n The network of shareable power banks is expected to offer solutions for students, tourists, and workers on the go so they can keep their smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other electronics charged.\nBy connecting users to a network of shareable devices, the company aims to combat climate change and promote sustainable consumption patterns.    The idea of the \"GoChargeTech\" project came to life in the middle of 2021, and since then, the backend infrastructure and code to manage stations have been developed in the alpha version. The mobile app is also ready to accept credit card payments.\nPeople looking to buy the token can head over for the Public Sale on the BHero launchpad. They can also read the white paper on their website  https://gocharge.tech/.\n   Media Contact    Contact Person Name: Ion Vrinceanu    Company Name: GoCharge Tech    Email: contact@gocharge.tech    Website: https://gocharge.tech/\n",

    "content": "NEW YORK, March  17, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO), and Cognyte Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CGNT). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT)  Class Period: August 30, 2021 - October 31, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 25, 2023  This case is about the rise and fall of a company that initially benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic (also referred to herein as “COVID-19,” “COVID,” or the “pandemic”). As a vaccine manufacturer, Catalent was one of the beneficiaries of COVID because it seemed well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for vaccine production capacity. Indeed, Catalent almost doubled its business during the first year of the pandemic when the bulk of vaccines were administered. Catalent’s success during the early stages of the pandemic caused its stock price to soar to record highs. By mid-2021, when COVID-related work dropped off, Defendants engaged in accounting and channel stuffing schemes to pad the Company’s revenues. These schemes gave Catalent the appearance of continued growth, causing its stock price to reach new record highs. Meanwhile, to support these schemes and keep pace with its lofty growth targets, Catalent was cutting corners on safety and control procedures at key production facilities. By late 2022, Catalent reported significant sales declines and excess inventory throughout its supply chain. As a result, Catalent stock dropped to pre-COVID levels causing substantial losses to its investors as they learned that Catalent’s early-COVID revenues were never sustainable, and its Class Period revenues were the product of securities fraud.  By way of background, Catalent is a multinational corporation that manufactures and packages drugs into delivery devices fit for human consumption (i.e., pre-filled syringes, vials, pills, etc.) pursuant to long-term supply contracts with pharmaceutical companies. Catalent directly sells these products to pharmaceutical companies which later sell them through the supply chain to healthcare providers (i.e., hospitals, clinics, etc.), which administer them to patients, who are the end consumers.   Prior to the onset of the pandemic, Catalent’s quarterly revenue averaged approximately $669 million between April 2018 and March 2020. During the period that those revenues were reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of approximately $47.57 per share. In early 2020, Catalent took on numerous large-scale COVID projects, including filling vaccines into syringes for Moderna and AstraZeneca. Those projects catapulted the Company’s quarterly revenues to record highs, which averaged approximately $940 million between April 2020 and March 2021, a 40 percent jump over pre-COVID revenues. Over the period when that revenue surge was reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of $102.42 per share.  By mid-2021, as the pandemic wore on, demand for Catalent’s COVID products decreased because vaccinations had already been administered to a large number of potential patients. For example, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) data indicates that COVID vaccinations in the United States reached an all-time high of 4.5 million doses on April 1, 2021, and averaged 1.5 million daily doses between December 14, 2020 and August 28, 2021. By comparison, CDC data indicates that average daily vaccinations in the United States were under 625,000 during the Class Period.  Despite this marked decline in the demand for COVID vaccines, Catalent continued to report growing revenues and assured investors that customer demand remained strong during the Class Period. The average quarterly revenue reported during the Class Period was $1.2 billion, an 80 percent increase over pre-COVID-19 revenues and a 28 percent increase over its reported revenues for the first year of the pandemic. Unbeknownst to investors, Defendants artificially inflated these revenues through fraudulent accounting and channel stuffing schemes to mislead investors into believing that Catalent was generating sustainable revenue growth. Defendants’ fraud caused Catalent stock to trade at a record high of $142.64 per share on September 9, 2021 and an average closing price of approximately $108.00 per share during the Class Period.  Statements made by Defendants throughout the Class Period were materially false and misleading when made because they misrepresented or failed to disclose the following adverse facts, which were known to Defendants or recklessly disregarded by them:  a. Catalent materially overstated its revenue and earnings by prematurely recognizing revenue in violation of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”);  b. Catalent had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to revenue recognition;  c. Catalent falsely represented demand for its products while it knowingly sold more product to its direct customers than could be sold to healthcare providers and end consumers;  d. Catalent disregarded regulatory rules at key production facilities in order to rapidly produce excess inventory that was used to pad the Company’s financial results through premature revenue recognition in violation of GAAP and/or stuffing its direct customers with this excess inventory; and  e. As a result of the foregoing, Defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company’s financial performance, outlook, and regulatory compliance during the Class Period.  Catalent’s misrepresentations were first revealed to the market on August 29, 2022, when the Company disclosed that demand for its COVID-related products was facing substantial headwinds. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 7.4 percent to close at $92.28 per share on August 29, 2022.  Then, on September 20, 2022, a Washington Post report exposed that the release of COVID-19 vaccines produced by Catalent had been delayed by regulators because of improper sterilization at one of Catalent’s key facilities. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 9.3 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $79.06 per share on September 22, 2022.  On November 1, 2022, Catalent revealed that its quarterly earnings had declined to zero and lowered its financial guidance, indicating falling demand. The Company also disclosed that regulatory issues at its key facilities were negatively impacting its financial results. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 31.7 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $44.90 per share on November 2, 2022. All told, over the course of the Class period, Catalent stock fell from a high above $142.00 to close at $44.90 on November 2, 2022, a more than 68 percent decline.  On November 16, 2022, Catalent revealed that it was carrying approximately $400 million in excess inventory, further revealing that the Company had misrepresented demand for its products as well as its purported ability to predict future demand. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 8.5 percent, over two trading sessions, to close at $42.07 per share on November 17, 2022.  Then, on December 8, 2022, GlassHouse Research published a report claiming that Catalent had been materially overstating its revenues by $568.2 million in violation of GAAP. The report detailed numerous red flags that were indicative of Catalent’s improper accounting practices. These red flags included the rapid increase in Catalent’s contract asset and inventory balances, declining customer deposits, executive turnover, and recent scrutiny of the Company’s revenue accounting by regulators. The report also described how Catalent’s direct customers were stuffed with excess inventory which “will take years to unwind.” On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined 3.6 percent to close at $45.54 per share on December 8, 2022.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of Catalent securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

(NASDAQ: TSLA)  Class Period: February 19, 2019 - February 17, 2023  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2023  Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles, battery energy storage, solar panels and roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is headquartered in Austin, Texas and incorporated in Delaware. The Company’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “TSLA”.  In 2014, Tesla announced Tesla Autopilot (“Autopilot”), a suite of purportedly advanced driver-assistance system (“ADAS”) features including automated lane-centering, traffic-aware cruise control, lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation, and self-parking. In September 2014, all Tesla cars started shipping with the sensors and software necessary to support the Autopilot system. Since then, the Company has touted refinements and enhancements to the Company’s ADAS and Autopilot features, including so-called “Full Self-Driving” (“FSD”) software, which purportedly enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system.  Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants had significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company’s Autopilot and FSD technologies; (ii) contrary to Defendants’ representations, Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury associated with the operation of Tesla vehicles; (iii) all the foregoing subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm; and (iv) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.  On April 18, 2021, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle with “no one” driving it had crashed into a tree, killing two passengers near Houston, Texas in a “fiery” crash. A Harris County Precinct constable told local news station KPRC 2 that the investigation showed “no one was driving” the 2019 Tesla vehicle when the accident occurred.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $25.15 per share, or 3.4%, to close at $714.63 per share on April 19, 2021.  On August 16, 2021, media outlets reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) had opened a formal investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles. The scope of the investigation included 765,000 vehicles, or nearly every vehicle that Tesla has sold in the U.S. since the start of the 2014 model year.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $31.00 per share, or 4.32%, to close at $686.17 per share on August 16, 2021.  On June 3, 2022, media outlets reported that NHTSA had issued a formal inquiry to Tesla about the Autopilot and FSD features for certain models of its vehicles after receiving complaints from more than 750 owners of the vehicles about sudden and unexpected braking with no immediate cause.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $71.45 per share, or 9.22%, to close at $703.55 per share on June 3, 2022.  On January 27, 2023, media outlets reported that the SEC was investigating statements made by Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Defendant Elon R. Musk (“Musk”), concerning the Autopilot system, including whether Musk made inappropriate forward-looking statements regarding the Autopilot system.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $11.24 per share, or 6.32%, to close at $166.66 per share on January 30, 2023.  On February 16, 2023, media outlets reported that NHTSA had ordered a recall of nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the Company’s FSD “Beta” software, stating that the software may allow the equipped vehicles to act “in an unlawful or unpredictable manner,” increasing the risk of a crash.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $12.20 per share, or 5.69%, to close at $202.04 per share on February 16, 2023.  Then, on February 18, 2023, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle had crashed into a fire truck that was responding to an earlier accident, killing the driver and injuring a passenger and four firefighters. News reports linked the crash with prior reports of Tesla vehicles crashing into stationary emergency vehicles as a consequence of poorly performing ADAS technologies, increasing market and public concerns regarding the Autopilot system in Tesla’s vehicles.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $10.94 per share, or 5.25%, to close at $197.37 per share on February 21, 2023, the next trading day.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common stock, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.  For more information on the Tesla class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TSLA  DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO)  Class Period: In connection with the June 2021 IPO  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023  DLocal, which conducted its IPO in New York and trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “DLO,” connects global merchants to emerging markets, earning revenues from fees charged to merchants in connection with payment processing services for cross-border and local payment transactions.  In June 2021, Defendants (defined below) commenced DLocal’s IPO, issuing over 33.8 million shares at $21.00 per share, including the full exercise of the Underwriter Defendants’ (defined herein) option to purchase additional shares, all pursuant to the Registration Statement.  Among other things, the Registration Statement repeatedly touts DLocal’s supposed “growing and deepening relationships” with new and existing global merchant clients. The Registration Statement tells prospective investors that DLocal measures its success by means of its “cohort” performance in terms of TPV, or total payment volume, and offers historic TPV data to support the narrative that DLocal has a strong track record. In addition, the Registration Statement advises prospective investors that a remediation plan designed to improve the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting is being implemented, assuring the market that DLocal is serious about its internal controls over financial reporting.  The Registration Statement’s numerous representations about DLocal’s TPV and its internal controls over financial reporting, however, contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state material facts both required by governing regulations and necessary to make the statements made not misleading. Specifically, the Registration Statement misrepresents the TPV derived from new merchants in DLocal’s 2019 and 2020 cohorts, which, at the time of the IPO, were severely lower than what the Registration Statement reported, as well as the fact that the remediation plan DLocal implemented before the IPO was patently defective and, thus, incapable of improving the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.  When the truth regarding the Company’s TPV and internal controls reached the market, DLocal’s common stock cratered over 50%. All told, investors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.  For more information on the DLocal class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DLO  Cognyte Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CGNT)  Class Period: February 2, 2021 - June 28, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023  On December 16, 2021, after the market closed, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, issued a “Threat Report,” which included the results of its “months long” investigation into the “surveillance-for-hire industry,” revealing for the first time that Cognyte (along with six private companies) regularly targeted, without their knowledge, journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists around the world, and collected intelligence on these people by manipulating them to reveal information and/or by compromising their devices and accounts, in violation of Facebook’s “multiple community standards and Terms of Service.” In particular, the Threat Report revealed that Cognyte “sells access to its platform which enables managing fake accounts across social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and VKontakte (VK), and other websites to social-engineer people and collect data.” This conduct “violated multiple Community Standards and Terms of Service,” and “given the severity of their violations,” Meta disabled Cognyte’s ability to use its platforms (removing about 100 accounts on Facebook and Instagram), shared its findings with security researchers, other platforms, and policymakers, issued Cease and Desist warnings, and alerted the nearly 50,000 individuals (across 100 countries) who were believed to be targeted to help them strengthen the security of their accounts.  On this news, the price of Cognyte’s common stock fell 5.11%, closing on December 17, 2021, at $18 per share, before declining another 5.5% the next trading day. By December 22, 2021, Cognyte’s stock had fallen to trade at $15 per share, representing a decline of nearly 21%.  Then, on April 5, 2022, Cognyte issued its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the period ended January 31, 2022 (the “2021 Annual Report”), revealing that the Company was forced to modify its solutions in response to the Threat Report, stating in relevant part:  Our solutions capture, fuse and analyze data collected from various sources, including from commercial web sources and social platforms. Such sources and platforms may allege that our solutions and techniques for capturing and collecting data and information from such sources violate their terms of use or other propriety rights of such sources or of their users. In December 2021, Meta Platforms Inc., or Meta, issued a report alleging that certain solutions offered by us that interface with Facebook and Instagram platforms violate their terms of use. Concurrently with the issuance of the foregoing report, Meta announced that it had removed accounts that it claimed were associated with our solutions and requested we cease data collection from its social platforms. In response to Meta’s allegations, we made modifications to certain features of our solutions, which impacted the manner our customers can use these solutions. Any allegations that our solutions and techniques infringe the terms of use or rights of third parties may result in legal claims against us or our customers. These claims may damage our reputation, adversely impact our customer relationships and create liability for us.  On the same day it published its 2021 Annual Report, Cognyte reported its fourth quarter 2021 financial results, representing the period during which Facebook disrupted and disabled Cognyte’s use of its platforms for purposes of reconnaissance. Cognyte badly missed analyst consensus estimates for non-GAAP earnings per share and sales, and significantly undershot the midpoint of its guidance range by several millions of dollars, citing in the Company’s accompanying press release “lower conversions within [its] product pipeline,” among other macroenvironmental challenges. Specifically, the Company’s non-GAAP earnings of $0.16 per share were not only down significantly from the $0.36 per share it earned in the year-ago quarter but also $0.06 per share below analysts’ expectations of $0.22 per share. Similarly, Cognyte’s sales of $124.9 million, representing a less than 1% increase from the year-ago period, also came significantly below analysts’ consensus estimate of $129.6 million.  The response from analysts was swift with many reducing their price targets, including Wedbush, who lowered their price target from $17 to $9 and concluded: [T]he Cognyte business model is turning into a debacle of [ ] epic proportions for investors that once believed in the story. Since the spin-off from Verint over the past year, the Cognyte story ha[s] been a nightmare for investors as the execution shortfalls, longer sales cycles, and myriad of challenges has created a perfect storm for the Street. Most troubling to us is that CGNT was unable to guide for 1Q23 and 2023, which means to us that management may not have their arms around the sales execution and headwinds in our opinion.  The market also responded immediately and harshly. Cognyte’s stock price plummeted over 31% on unusually high trading volume, closing at $8.03 per share on April 5, 2022, which was down $3.63 per share from its April 4, 2022 close of $11.66 per share.  Then, on June 28, 2022, Cognyte released its first quarter 2022 financial results, which, once again, badly missed analyst estimates across the board. Cognyte’s 1Q22 revenue of $87 million, for example, represented a decline of 25%. Analysts were expecting a decline of 2%.  In response, analysts immediately downgraded the Company’s rating and reduced their price targets. William Blair, for example, downgraded Cognyte to “market perform” and concluded that Cognyte’s “low pipeline conversion” issues were a symptom of a broader problem, stating in relevant part:  Cognyte’s brand has been negatively impacted by increased scrutiny of the cyber intelligence industry and fellow Israel cyber surveillance firm NSO Group. Last fall, the U.S. government blacklisted the NSO Group after a multitude of reports surfaced that its software was being used inappropriately by governments to spy on citizens with dissenting views.

    "content": "Faster, lighter, quieter, and more cost effective than before, Blink’s new portable EV charger provides EV fleets with range confidence and creates new service offering for roadside assistance providers  Miami Beach, FL, March  15, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blink Charging Co. (Nasdaq: BLNK) (“Blink” or the “Company”), a leading owner and operator of electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and services, today announced the immediate availability of its redesigned Blink mobile charger. The freestanding charger is built to provide emergency charging for stranded electric vehicles, directly addressing the needs of EV fleet operators, roadside assistance providers, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, and public roadway assistance programs.  The Blink mobile charger is rated at 32 amps and charges an EV with up to 0.5 to 1 mile of range per minute, allowing a stranded vehicle to receive adequate charge to drive to the nearest EV charging station and eliminates the need for the vehicle to be towed. The mobile charger is capable of Wi-Fi connectivity allowing roadside providers to charge EV drivers a flat fee or per usage during a roadside event. The unit is compatible with all electric vehicles and Level 2 fleet vehicles, including all Tesla models.  “We are excited to introduce our all-new, innovative portable EV charger that is available now. This product creates confidence for EV drivers and fleet operators that there is a reliable and cost-effective solution for vehicle rescue and uptime,” said Michael D. Farkas, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blink Charging. “The Blink Portable Charger reaffirms to our members and customers that Blink is actively committed to providing freedom and flexibility for EV drivers while continuing to expand our charging station footprint globally, building the infrastructure needed to benefit the growing number of emerging EVs.”  “The vehicle roadside assistance market continues to grow with projected estimates to reach nearly $35 billion globally by 2030. With the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, service providers require a solution that addresses EV owner’s needs,” continued Farkas. “We are pleased that demand for this product is already showing strength.”  The traditional gas-powered EV charger delivers a significant reduction in weight, size, noise and cost, from its predecessor model, making it more compact, accessible, and transportable but with the same reliable experience as the previous generation unit.

    "content": "NEW YORK, March  06, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Alico, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALCO), Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.  Alico, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALCO)  Class Period: February 4, 2021 - December 13, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 18, 2023  Alico, together with its subsidiaries, operates as an agribusiness and land management company in the U.S. The Company operates in two segments: (i) Alico Citrus; and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations. The Alico Citrus segment cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. The Land Management and Other Operations segment owns and manages land in Collier, Glades, and Hendry Counties, and also leases land for recreational and grazing purposes, conservation, and mining activities.  Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Alico had deficient disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (ii) as a result, the Company had improperly calculated Alico’s deferred tax liabilities over a multi-year period; (iii) accordingly, the Company would likely be required to restate one or more of its previously issued financial statements; (iv) the foregoing would impede the timely completion of the audit of the Company’s financial results in advance of its year-end earnings call; and (v) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.  On December 6, 2022, Alico issued a press release announcing that the Company was postponing its year-end earnings call. Specifically, the press release stated that “additional time is required for completion of the audit of its financial results for the period ended September 30, 2022 by its independent registered public accounting firm.”  On this news, Alico’s stock price fell $3.06 per share, or 10.42%, to close at $26.29 per share on December 6, 2022.  Then, on December 7, 2022, Alico issued a press release providing a further update on the delays that the Company faced in reporting fiscal year 2022 results and making the required associated filings with the SEC. In the press release, the Company disclosed that “[t]he key item that is requiring such additional time involves evaluation of the proper amount of the Company’s Deferred Tax Liability, particularly certain portions of that Deferred Tax Liability arising in prior fiscal years, including those going back to fiscal year 2019 or possibly several years before fiscal year 2019.”  Finally, on December 13, 2022, Alico filed with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 (the “2022 10-K”). In the 2022 10-K, Alico “restate[d] the Company’s previously issued audited consolidated balance sheet, audited consolidated statements of changes in equity and related disclosures as of September 30, 2021 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021 (the ‘2021 10-K’) previously filed with the SEC and the Company’s previously issued unaudited consolidated balance sheet, unaudited consolidated statements of changes in equity and related disclosures as of the end of each quarterly periods ended June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 included in the Company’s respective Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for each of the quarters then ended previously filed with the SEC (together with the 2021 10-K, the ‘Financial Statements’).” The Company also disclosed that “[o]n December 12, 2022, the audit committee (the ‘Audit Committee’) of the board of directors of the Company concluded that the Company’s previously issued Financial Statements can no longer be relied upon due to an error identified during the completion of the 2022 10-K.” Specifically, Alico stated that “[t]he error that led to the Audit Committee’s conclusion relates to the calculation of the deferred tax liabilities for the fiscal years 2015 through 2019, which resulted in a cumulative reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liability, and a corresponding cumulative increase in retained earnings, of approximately $2,512,000 on the Company’s balance sheet as of September 30, 2022.”  On this news, Alico’s stock price fell $2.64 per share, or 9.53%, to close at $25.05 per share on December 14, 2022.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.  For more information on the Alico class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALCO  Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT)  Class Period: August 30, 2021 - October 31, 2022  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 25, 2023  This case is about the rise and fall of a company that initially benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic (also referred to herein as “COVID-19,” “COVID,” or the “pandemic”). As a vaccine manufacturer, Catalent was one of the beneficiaries of COVID because it seemed well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for vaccine production capacity. Indeed, Catalent almost doubled its business during the first year of the pandemic when the bulk of vaccines were administered. Catalent’s success during the early stages of the pandemic caused its stock price to soar to record highs. By mid-2021, when COVID-related work dropped off, Defendants engaged in accounting and channel stuffing schemes to pad the Company’s revenues. These schemes gave Catalent the appearance of continued growth, causing its stock price to reach new record highs. Meanwhile, to support these schemes and keep pace with its lofty growth targets, Catalent was cutting corners on safety and control procedures at key production facilities. By late 2022, Catalent reported significant sales declines and excess inventory throughout its supply chain. As a result, Catalent stock dropped to pre-COVID levels causing substantial losses to its investors as they learned that Catalent’s early-COVID revenues were never sustainable, and its Class Period revenues were the product of securities fraud.  By way of background, Catalent is a multinational corporation that manufactures and packages drugs into delivery devices fit for human consumption (i.e., pre-filled syringes, vials, pills, etc.) pursuant to long-term supply contracts with pharmaceutical companies. Catalent directly sells these products to pharmaceutical companies which later sell them through the supply chain to healthcare providers (i.e., hospitals, clinics, etc.), which administer them to patients, who are the end consumers.   Prior to the onset of the pandemic, Catalent’s quarterly revenue averaged approximately $669 million between April 2018 and March 2020. During the period that those revenues were reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of approximately $47.57 per share. In early 2020, Catalent took on numerous large-scale COVID projects, including filling vaccines into syringes for Moderna and AstraZeneca. Those projects catapulted the Company’s quarterly revenues to record highs, which averaged approximately $940 million between April 2020 and March 2021, a 40 percent jump over preCOVID revenues. Over the period when that revenue surge was reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of $102.42 per share.  By mid-2021, as the pandemic wore on, demand for Catalent’s COVID products decreased because vaccinations had already been administered to a large number of potential patients. For example, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) data indicates that COVID vaccinations in the United States reached an all-time high of 4.5 million doses on April 1, 2021, and averaged 1.5 million daily doses between December 14, 2020 and August 28, 2021. By comparison, CDC data indicates that average daily vaccinations in the United States were under 625,000 during the Class Period.  Despite this marked decline in the demand for COVID vaccines, Catalent continued to report growing revenues and assured investors that customer demand remained strong during the Class Period. The average quarterly revenue reported during the Class Period was $1.2 billion, an 80 percent increase over preCOVID-19 revenues and a 28 percent increase over its reported revenues for the first year of the pandemic. Unbeknownst to investors, Defendants artificially inflated these revenues through fraudulent accounting and channel stuffing schemes to mislead investors into believing that Catalent was generatingsustainable revenue growth. Defendants’ fraud caused Catalent stock to trade at a record high of $142.64 per share on September 9, 2021 and an average closing price of approximately $108.00 per share during the Class Period.  Statements made by Defendants throughout the Class Period were materially false and misleading when made because they misrepresented or failed to disclose the following adverse facts, which were known to Defendants or recklessly disregarded by them:  a. Catalent materially overstated its revenue and earnings by prematurely recognizing revenue in violation of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”);  b. Catalent had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to revenue recognition;  c. Catalent falsely represented demand for its products while it knowingly sold more product to its direct customers than could be sold to healthcare providers and end consumers;  d. Catalent disregarded regulatory rules at key production facilities in order to rapidly produce excess inventory that was used to pad the Company’s financial results through premature revenue recognition in violation of GAAP and/or stuffing its direct customers with this excess inventory; and  e. As a result of the foregoing, Defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company’s financial performance, outlook, and regulatory compliance during the Class Period.  Catalent’s misrepresentations were first revealed to the market on August 29, 2022, when the Company disclosed that demand for its COVID-related products was facing substantial headwinds. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 7.4 percent to close at $92.28 per share on August 29, 2022.  Then, on September 20, 2022, a Washington Post report exposed that the release of COVID-19 vaccines produced by Catalent had been delayed by regulators because of improper sterilization at one of Catalent’s key facilities. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 9.3 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $79.06 per share on September 22, 2022.  On November 1, 2022, Catalent revealed that its quarterly earnings had declined to zero and lowered its financial guidance, indicating falling demand. The Company also disclosed that regulatory issues at its key facilities were negatively impacting its financial results. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 31.7 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $44.90 per share on November 2, 2022. All told, over the course of the Class period, Catalent stock fell from a high above $142.00 to close at $44.90 on November 2, 2022, a more than 68 percent decline.  On November 16, 2022, Catalent revealed that it was carrying approximately $400 million in excess inventory, further revealing that the Company had misrepresented demand for its products as well as its purported ability to predict future demand. On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined by 8.5 percent, over two trading sessions, to close at $42.07 per share on November 17, 2022.  Then, on December 8, 2022, GlassHouse Research published a report claiming that Catalent had been materially overstating its revenues by $568.2 million in violation of GAAP. The report detailed numerous red flags that were indicative of Catalent’s improper accounting practices. These red flags included the rapid increase in Catalent’s contract asset and inventory balances, declining customer deposits, executive turnover, and recent scrutiny of the Company’s revenue accounting by regulators. The report also described how Catalent’s direct customers were stuffed with excess inventory which “will take years to unwind.” On this news, Catalent’s stock price declined 3.6 percent to close at $45.54 per share on December 8, 2022.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of Catalent securities, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.

(NASDAQ: TSLA)  Class Period: February 19, 2019 - February 17, 2023  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2023  Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles, battery energy storage, solar panels and roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is headquartered in Austin, Texas and incorporated in Delaware. The Company’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “TSLA”.  In 2014, Tesla announced Tesla Autopilot (“Autopilot”), a suite of purportedly advanced driver-assistance system (“ADAS”) features including automated lane-centering, traffic-aware cruise control, lane changes, semi-autonomous navigation, and self-parking. In September 2014, all Tesla cars started shipping with the sensors and software necessary to support the Autopilot system. Since then, the Company has touted refinements and enhancements to the Company’s ADAS and Autopilot features, including so-called “Full Self-Driving” (“FSD”) software, which purportedly enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system.  Throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants had significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company’s Autopilot and FSD technologies; (ii) contrary to Defendants’ representations, Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury associated with the operation of Tesla vehicles; (iii) all the foregoing subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm; and (iv) as a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.  On April 18, 2021, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle with “no one” driving it had crashed into a tree, killing two passengers near Houston, Texas in a “fiery” crash. A Harris County Precinct constable told local news station KPRC 2 that the investigation showed “no one was driving” the 2019 Tesla vehicle when the accident occurred.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $25.15 per share, or 3.4%, to close at $714.63 per share on April 19, 2021.  On August 16, 2021, media outlets reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) had opened a formal investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles. The scope of the investigation included 765,000 vehicles, or nearly every vehicle that Tesla has sold in the U.S. since the start of the 2014 model year.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $31.00 per share, or 4.32%, to close at $686.17 per share on August 16, 2021.  On June 3, 2022, media outlets reported that NHTSA had issued a formal inquiry to Tesla about the Autopilot and FSD features for certain models of its vehicles after receiving complaints from more than 750 owners of the vehicles about sudden and unexpected braking with no immediate cause.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $71.45 per share, or 9.22%, to close at $703.55 per share on June 3, 2022.  On January 27, 2023, media outlets reported that the SEC was investigating statements made by Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Defendant Elon R. Musk (“Musk”), concerning the Autopilot system, including whether Musk made inappropriate forward-looking statements regarding the Autopilot system.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $11.24 per share, or 6.32%, to close at $166.66 per share on January 30, 2023.  On February 16, 2023, media outlets reported that NHTSA had ordered a recall of nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the Company’s FSD “Beta” software, stating that the software may allow the equipped vehicles to act “in an unlawful or unpredictable manner,” increasing the risk of a crash.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $12.20 per share, or 5.69%, to close at $202.04 per share on February 16, 2023.  Then, on February 18, 2023, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle had crashed into a fire truck that was responding to an earlier accident, killing the driver and injuring a passenger and four firefighters. News reports linked the crash with prior reports of Tesla vehicles crashing into stationary emergency vehicles as a consequence of poorly performing ADAS technologies, increasing market and public concerns regarding the Autopilot system in Tesla’s vehicles.  On this news, Tesla’s stock price fell $10.94 per share, or 5.25%, to close at $197.37 per share on February 21, 2023, the next trading day.  As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common stock, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.  For more information on the Tesla class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TSLA  DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO)  Class Period: In connection with the June 2021 IPO  Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023  DLocal, which conducted its IPO in New York and trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “DLO,” connects global merchants to emerging markets, earning revenues from fees charged to merchants in connection with payment processing services for cross-border and local payment transactions.  In June 2021, Defendants (defined below) commenced DLocal’s IPO, issuing over 33.8 million shares at $21.00 per share, including the full exercise of the Underwriter Defendants’ (defined herein) option to purchase additional shares, all pursuant to the Registration Statement.  Among other things, the Registration Statement repeatedly touts DLocal’s supposed “growing and deepening relationships” with new and existing global merchant clients. The Registration Statement tells prospective investors that DLocal measures its success by means of its “cohort” performance in terms of TPV, or total payment volume, and offers historic TPV data to support the narrative that DLocal has a strong track record. In addition, the Registration Statement advises prospective investors that a remediation plan designed to improve the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting is being implemented, assuring the market that DLocal is serious about its internal controls over financial reporting.  The Registration Statement’s numerous representations about DLocal’s TPV and its internal controls over financial reporting, however, contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state material facts both required by governing regulations and necessary to make the statements made not misleading. Specifically, the Registration Statement misrepresents the TPV derived from new merchants in DLocal’s 2019 and 2020 cohorts, which, at the time of the IPO, were severely lower than what the Registration Statement reported, as well as the fact that the remediation plan DLocal implemented before the IPO was patently defective and, thus, incapable of improving the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.  When the truth regarding the Company’s TPV and internal controls reached the market, DLocal’s common stock cratered over 50%. All told, investors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.

    "content": "BALTIMORE--(\nBUSINESS WIRE\n)--\nMyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n®\n(Nasdaq: MYMD) (“MyMD” or “the Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing groundbreaking therapies for the treatment of serious and debilitating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, today announced that it has joined\nLOT Network\n, the international, non-profit community of companies working together to protect themselves against litigation brought on by patent assertion entities (PAEs, also known as “patent trolls”). MyMD’s joining the LOT (License on Transfer) Network’s community of 2,800+ companies is intended to enable MyMD to protect the interests of the Company against patent assertion entities.\nThe LOT Network community is committed to protecting members against frivolous PAE litigation. Members agree that if, and only if, a member’s patent asset falls into the hands of a PAE, other members are granted a license to that patent – rendering them immune to a PAE lawsuit using that patent. With a total of 2,289 patent troll cases in 2022 alone,\n1\nthe average lawsuit costing $4 million to defend,\n2\nand 87% of patent assets used in PAE lawsuits originating from operating companies,\n3\nLOT Network’s coverage of nearly 4 million patent assets globally provides broad protection and peace of mind to member companies.\n“\nBiotech companies are increasingly finding themselves defending costly patent-troll lawsuits,” said Christopher Chapman, MD, Director, and Chief Medical Officer at MyMD Pharmaceuticals. “\nMyMD joins a growing number of life science companies leveraging LOT Network as a layer of protection against troll litigation, so that we can continue to focus our resources on our clinical development programs and protect our expansive IP portfolio and the interests of our shareholders.”\n“\nWe are pleased to welcome MyMD into LOT Network,” said Ken Seddon, CEO of LOT Network. “\nJoining the community demonstrates their commitment to preserving their resources for innovation and protecting their ecosystem against unwanted litigation.”\nAbout MyMD Pharmaceuticals\nMyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYMD), is a clinical stage biopharma company developing groundbreaking therapies for the treatment of serious and debilitating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. MyMD’s lead clinical candidate, MYMD-1®, is an orally available next-generation TNF-alpha inhibitor with the potential to transform the way that TNF-alpha based diseases are treated. MYMD-1®, with its small molecule design, improved safety profile and ability to cross the blood brain barrier, has the promise to provide meaningful therapeutic solutions to patients not served by current TNF-alpha inhibitors and as a potential therapy for CNS-based inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. MYMD-1 has demonstrated the potential to slow the aging process and extend healthy lifespan. The company is evaluating MYMD-1® in Phase 2 studies for sarcopenia/frailty, a result of the aging process, as well as early-stage trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with the potential to expand into other applications. MyMD’s second therapeutic candidate is Supera-CBD™, a novel, synthetic, non-toxic cannabidiol (CBD) analog that is 8000 times more potent a CB2 agonist (activator) than plant-based CBD. In addition to its potential role in managing addiction, anxiety, chronic pain and seizures, Supera-CBD has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.

TESLA'S NEW WINDSHIELD WIPER TECH GETS A PATENT  Tesla's first diner is set to be built in Hollywood. (Tesla)Tesla has also filed for trademark protection for its name to be used for restaurant services.  The company purchased a former Shakey's Pizza location for $16 million. (Google Street View)No further details were shared, like what is inside and expected to be on the menu; however, last year, Tesla purchased a $16 million property on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, California, to build on. The location used to be the home of a Shakey's Pizza.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE FOX NEWS AUTOS NEWSLETTERA firm timetable for construction has not been announced.  Tesla may soon offer a wireless charging mat for its cars. (Tesla)There was another teaser image posted alongside it that appeared to show a Tesla in a garage using a wireless charging mat on the floor, but the presenter did not reference either image directly, only saying that \"we also want to make sure that we continue to focus on providing really incredible charging experiences.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTesla does not currently offer the technology, which uses inductive charging like a smartphone charging pad, but it would allow owners to simply park their car over it to charge without having to plug it in.

    "content": "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, March  02, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ELCORA ADVANCED MATERIALS CORP. (TSX.V:ERA | Frankfurt:ELM | OTCQB – ECORF), (the \"Company\" or \"Elcora\"), is pleased to share its year 2022 accomplishments and plans for the year 2023.  Corporate Plans and Objectives  Elcora Advanced Materials' goal is to be a globally competitive extractor and processor of battery-grade minerals and metals, focused on emerging opportunities in the global battery value chain. Elcora is well-positioned to establish itself as a leader in battery material with both known metal deposits and untapped mineral sites with great potential.  The Company’s mandate is focused on the global battery value chain. More specifically, we plan on both extracting and processing battery-grade minerals and metals from current projects and apply them to proprietary energy storage applications. Elcora’s expertise and experience in Graphite, Graphene and Li-Ion battery applications developed over the last decade will be combined with additional battery metal opportunities.  Battery technologies are integrated into complex and rapidly growing global industries that provide solutions for the electrification of transportation, consumer electronics, industrial automation and stationary energy storage for utility-scale, micro-grid, and behind-the-meter power applications. Battery adoption stretches across established and emerging sectors, from mining and transportation to renewable energy.  During the second half of 2021, the Company began a search for a battery metals mining project to enhance both its mining and energy storage solutions by adding additional markets beyond its graphite-based li-ion technologies. At the end of 2021, Elcora acquired 100% of ERMAZON S.A.R.L (“ERMAZON”) which owns Vanadium, Copper and Manganese Research Permits / Concessions sites in Morocco. This strategic acquisition supports Elcora’s plan to enhance both its mining and energy storage solutions by adding additional metal markets related to battery technologies.  As per the geological features of the country, Morocco is well known for hosting a large number of battery minerals and metals including Vanadium, Lead, Copper, Silver, Cobalt, Gold, Nickel and Manganese resources.  The new Moroccan mining code allows for three steps of mining rights: 1) an Exploration Authorization, under which applicants must enter into a contract with the mining administration detailing the planned exploration activities and investments; 2) a Research Permit, granted for three years over an area measuring 4 km by 4 km; and 3) an Exploitation (mining) License, granted for ten-year terms and renewable for successive periods of ten years until the reserves are exhausted. The Elcora / Ermazon team is currently researching the different concessions to meet all the legal requirements of the Ministry of Mines to obtain the Exploitation Licenses.  The Manganese Short-term Opportunity   The Ermazon Manganese concession (16 km²) in Morocco named “Atlas Fox Deposit” was mined until the mid-fifties when the French rule in Morocco came to an end. The neighboring village was built for staff accommodation and administration. The mining methods were basic with a combination of open pit and underground methods.  In addition to several industrial applications, Manganese is an electric vehicle or EV metal. It is used to produce batteries for electric vehicles and other renewable energy applications such as electricity grid storage for Tesla’s batteries. Its status as a battery metal is expected to propel its demand in the wake of what experts predict will be a widespread transition to EVs driven by lofty climate policy goals and zero emission targets.  As of the date of this Update, the Company received positive lab test results for the first twelve (12) assays from its Atlas Fox Deposit. All sample locations are mapped and easily accessible for surface deposit mining. The Manganese deposit is a vein/lens with two ridges from which ore was extracted, numerous quality stockpiles were found, and the vein is still exposed in many places.  The mining area is easily accessible via public road and an inclining mine haul road of 1.5 km length. Elcora will rehabilitate it including the former staging area situated at a road fork. The Company is preparing a comprehensive mining plan for the Atlas Fox Deposit. The plan will be based on detailed maps of the former French Mine located on its concession allowing for faster and more efficient production. The mining method will initially be open pit, heavy machinery and production equipment are already being shipped.  Elcora’s Manganese project is moving ahead with the objective to start production during the first half of 2023 with our local Moroccan team working diligently on getting the last Government requirements.  The Polymetallic/Vanadinite Project  Vanadium’s role in the growing energy grid storage will increase dramatically over the coming years, enabling wider use of renewable power such as wind and solar.  Vanadium Flow Battery (VFB) is a type of rechargeable flow battery that employs Vanadium to store chemical energy used for grid energy storage attached to power plants and electrical grids. Roll out of large-scale Vanadium flow batteries are underway across the globe, with many others being planned or under construction. Securing a strong supply of quality Vanadium minerals will be key to the growth of energy storage solutions.  Ermazon currently holds seventeen Polymetallic Vanadinite (Vanadium & Lead) Research Permits in different regions of the Kingdom of Morocco, for a total of 272 km2. Fifteen of those concessions are contiguous covering 240 km², the ‘’Atlas Lion Deposit’’. Elcora has begun an exploration program on two of those claims including geological mapping, sampling and assaying to conclude in June 2022 that there are at least 3 main Vanadinite veins in a 40m thick rock formation.  The main conclusion of the described ore findings is that this vast deposit shows large potential and justifies a comprehensive exploration program while allowing to start ore production in this area of exposed minerals.  In addition to the 17 Polymetallic/Vanadinite licenses, Elcora also owns one Copper Research License and one Manganese Research License which also includes a former Manganese mine. Most of those concessions are surface deposit allowing open-pit mining.  Elcora Processing Graphite:  In its pilot plant located at Elcora’s facility in Bedford, Nova Scotia Elcora has developed ways to economically extract graphite from mineralized material. So far, the Company has processed five tons of raw graphite from the Ruangwa mine in Tanzania and purified it to various grades for commercial use. The Company plans to target the expandable graphite market which is expected to grow significantly. Our plan is to continue testing with end users in both the raw graphite and battery anode markets.  According to Troy Grant, Chief Executive Officer, \"Since the beginning of 2020, we continued research and development in a very new, exciting, and ever evolving business. Over the last few years, Elcora has been working relentlessly to create value for its investors. In this effort, despite these uncertain times, to meet expected future demand, the Company has been actively exploring additional sources for battery metals and minerals essential for battery storage. We look forward to having something positive to report to shareholders in the coming weeks in this regard.\"  About Elcora Advanced Materials Corp.

    "content": "\nTesla Inc. will halt some production at its Shanghai factory until the end of February, as it upgrades the facility to start rolling out a revamped version of the Model 3 sedan in the competitive Chinese market.\nThe plant has two sections for vehicle manufacturing, and some workers on the first phase won’t be allowed on production lines as soon as Sunday as work on improving them is undertaken, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.\nTesla has been upgrading the lines in stages over the past two months, with deliveries of the new Model 3 sedan — which the company is yet to publicly confirm — expected to begin later this year, the people said. The section of the factory currently being worked on makes Model 3s and Model Y crossovers.\nThe revamp comes as Tesla faces increased competition in the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market. Model 3 sales in China have been declining, with about 125,000 of the sedans sold in 2022, a drop of 17 percent from the previous year. With local rivals like BYD Co. and Nio Inc. introducing rival models, Tesla has resorted to price cuts on China-built models to lift sales.\nStill, orders for made-in-China Teslas have started to flatten since the start of this month after an initial frenzy following the price cuts, one of the people said.\nMore than half of the 1.37 million EVs that Tesla built globally last year were made at the Shanghai factory, where cars first rolled off production lines in December 2019. After several upgrades, the facility — Tesla’s first outside the U.S. — has the capacity to produce about one million vehicles a year, more than double its original plan of 450,000.\nChina-based Tesla representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nTotal shipments of new-energy passenger vehicles to dealerships in China nearly doubled to 6.5 million in 2022, according to the Passenger Car Association, which expects a further 30 percent increase this year. Carmakers including Nio, Xpeng Inc. and Geely Automobile Holdings are all rolling out new models in a battle for market share.",

    "content": "DUBLIN--(\nBUSINESS WIRE\n)--The\n\"Gearing Up to Circular Autos: Opportunities from the Shift to Sustainable Mobility\"\nreport has been added to\nResearchAndMarkets.com's\noffering.\nCircular Autos represent a new vehicle class; fully-electric, connected vehicles built from the ground up with renewable resources and embedded recyclability.\nThey could be the silver bullet to the disruption the automotive industry faces; digitalization and sustainability amid the ripple effects of the worsening economic outlook. Circular Auto is the embodiment of clean, safe, and convenient movement of people and goods. Read this report to learn about the Top opportunities from the shift to Sustainable Mobility.\nThis report unveils the top opportunities in the transition to sustainable, electrified, connected, and shared mobility.\nRead this report to learn:\nHow can Circular Mobility lead the automotive transformation to sustainability;\nWhat is the impact of emission regulations and policies for Sustainable Vehicles;\nKey technological enablers and the pace of innovation for Circular Autos;\nTrends in consumer sentiment;\nStrategies to accelerate the transition to Sustainable Mobility\nThe evolving player Ecosystem: Leaders vs. Followers\nEmerging Circularity Hubs\nCircular Autos can address environmental goals and digital transformation\nCircularity and sustainability are becoming core parts of the strategic direction of carmakers and automotive suppliers due to emission regulations and climate policies, competition, and changing consumer needs.\nMany passenger car brands are already fully-electric, such as Tesla and Polestar. Still, their shift to climate neutrality is underway, with Tesla not making a commitment yet while Polestar has set 2040 as the goal.\nThe VW Group is targeting net carbon neutrality by 2050 with a combination of strategies that include a fully-electric car mix, off-setting unavoidable emissions, and many more. The VW Group expects its BEV mix to account for 20-25% of sales by 2025, amounting to 2-3 million units, of which VW will amount to circa 1 million.\nThe latest update of Renault Group's Renaulution plan will include creating a 360 circular economy company from the closed loop in materials to battery recycling, called \"The Future Is NEUTRAL\", an industry-first, according to the French carmaker.\nBMW aims at a 1/3 CO2 reduction across its value chain by 2030. The Group wants to become climate-neutral by 2050.\nPolestar and Volvo have set 2040 as their net-zero commitment target. Hyundai and KIA have set 2045.\nFord, VW, Mazda, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, and Isuzu have set 2050.\nZF, a major automotive supplier, is targeting net carbon neutrality by 2040. The company intends to incorporate sustainability as a unique selling proposition, from meeting the highest environmental standards in production to dealing with employees and being a reliable, ethical business partner\nRegulations are the biggest driver of transformation to Circular Autos. CO2 fleet compliance and targets for PHEV/BEV sales are increasing the cost of compliance of Internal Combustion Engines and driving the introduction of PHEVs and BEVs.\nWith the proliferation of electric vehicles, regulations are concerned about the environmental and social impact of EV batteries. The European Parliament is working on an update of the EU's battery directive to ensure that batteries can be repurposed, remanufactured or recycled at the end of their life.\nBut the shift to sustainability still faces adoption challenges\nA plethora of technological innovations in electric vehicle batteries, business models for 2nd life and recyclability, and industry collaboration will be crucial for the shift from Low to Full Circular Mobility.\nThe lack of regulatory harmonization, the absence of global cooperation to develop common standards, and consumer awareness are roadblocks to overcome.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1.

    "title": "Ferrari, Dodge fine-tune artificial noise for EVs",
    "content": "Future electric Ferraris could soon roar like the V-12 812 Competizione.\nHigh-performance car fans love the roar of V-8 and V-12 engines. But as vehicles using these powertrains start making way for electric vehicles, automakers including Stellantis and Ferrari are betting customers will still want to keep making noise with EVs.\nWhen Stellantis unveiled its Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Concept in August, the muscle-car brand debuted an industry-first exhaust system for EVs.\n“No, Dodge has not found a way for an electric car to pump equal parts engine noise and CO2 into the air,” Car and Driver wrote. It designed a system to amplify the near-silent hum of electric motors into “a 126-decibel cacophony worthy of the SRT badge.”\nFerrari too is working on a way to create distinctive noises tied to the actual performance of an EV powertrain, enabling drivers to not just feel but also hear realistic vehicle feedback.\nAnalysts at Oddo BHF last month flagged that the supercar maker had filed for a patent for its device, which could go into its first full-electric model coming in 2025.\nWhile the company has declined to comment on the device specifically, CEO Benedetto Vigna believes sound will be essential to any Ferrari, including those powered by battery.\n“I have no doubt that our electric powertrains will give clients the same thrills” as combustion engines, Vigna said in an interview.\n“The point is how to extract the best emotion from the use of this technology, giving something unique to the clients.”\nAutomakers have long fine-tuned the pitch that is emitted from their combustion engines, to the point that car buffs can name that tune when a particular generation Ford Mustang rolls up or distinguish between a Lamborghini or Bugatti roaring by.\nUnsurprisingly, enthusiasts with strong feelings about how a marque or model should sound have been unsparing in their early assessment of the Dodge concept’s mountain lion-like audio profile.\nBrand boss Tim Kuniskis told Motor Trend and Road & Track that much of the initial feedback about the Charger Daytona SRT Concept’s growl was negative, and that Dodge will keep refining it.\nThe distinct sounds brands such as Dodge and Ferrari are working on are much higher stakes than Tesla’s gimmicky “Fart Mode” that’s good for a laugh and little else.\nPerformance automakers will have their work cut out for them enticing customers to switch to a new type of drivetrain likely to render vehicles even more expensive.\nBecause EVs can barely be heard when going slowly, regulators in Europe, the U.S. and China have been requiring that they come with a built-in sound system that alerts bicyclists and pedestrians.\nAutomakers have a bit more room to maneuver with different sounds when EVs go faster and emit more tire and wind noise.\nSome have even turned to creative outsiders to give their vehicles a sonic edge.\nJaguar tapped electronic musician Richard Devine to design sounds for its first full EV, the i-Pace.\nVolkswagen hired Leslie Mandoki, a German-Hungarian music producer who has worked with Phil Collins and Chaka Khan, for the ID 3.\nBMW teamed with Oscar-winning film score composer Hans Zimmer — his works include Hollywood blockbusters Gladiator and The Lion King — to create special noises for its EVs, including a spaceship-like hum when powering up.\n“Ever since the industrial revolution and we have had combustion engines, the sound of cities — the sound of our lives — have been dictated by that,” Zimmer said in a video on the project.\n“Now, suddenly, we have the opportunity to change the sonic landscape of this whole planet.”",

    "content": "Includes self-propelled vacuum and mop, steam and ozone sanitization, a self-cleaning base and up to 82 minutes of cleaning timeBELLEVUE, Wash., Feb. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- eufy, Anker Innovation's smart appliance brand, today announced the launch of MACH, its new premium cleaning brand. MACH will deliver the most advanced solutions to home cleaning, combining the latest technology with never-before-seen features and sleek, modern aesthetics.\nContinue Reading\nEUFY UNVEILS THE MACH V1 ULTRA, THE WORLD'S FIRST CORDLESS STICK VACUUM WITH STEAM MOP\nTweet this\nMACH V1 Ultra from eufy is world's first cordless stick vacuum with steam mop.\n\"MACH represents a major breakthrough for the eufy brand,\" said Steven Yang, CEO of Anker Innovations. \"MACH is more than just a measurement of supersonic speed. It is about setting new standards and achieving the impossible, which is the philosophy behind eufy's new MACH brand. For a product to fall under the MACH umbrella, it must challenge the status quo, offering technology and innovation that defy expectations. The V1 Ultra is just the beginning, and we look forward to sharing details of other products under our new MACH brand soon.\"\nFeaturing a sleek, futuristic design, the \nMACH V1 Ultra sets a new precedent as the world's first cordless vacuum with steam-mopping capabilities.\nOther notable features include:\nSteamWave™ TechnologyThe SteamWave™ technology works by first dissolving the stain and then vacuuming and mopping the surface. The steam is continually released at a higher temperature of 230℉ to remove dirt and bacteria. The V1 Ultra is equipped with overheat protection, which pauses the steam delivery whenever the vacuum is lifted off the ground. This technology makes the V1 Ultra the world's first cordless stick vacuum with steam and mopping capabilities for a streamlined way to clean up any type of mess in a single pass without having to juggle cords.\nEco-Clean Ozone™ Disinfection and Tesla Valve Mixing™ TechnologyThis sterilization technology is used to sanitize the floor, and later, sanitizes the vacuum itself, including the rolling brush. Upon disinfecting the floor, the ozone breaks down into oxygen, making it non-toxic and most importantly, effective. According to a study done by the Technical Inspection Association (TUV) and Environmental Protection Agency, ozone technology reduces germs by up to 99%. For this reason, the V1 Ultra was awarded the first TUV certificate for a product of this caliber.The V1 Ultra includes a built-in generator with Tesla Valve Mixing™ technology that precisely proportions and mixes the cleaning solution with the water and, with the push of a button, releases the proper amount of solution for optimal cleaning. It can store up to 30 days of cleaning solution.\nJetStream™ Powerful Suction with Noise-Canceling TechnologyEquipped with suction power of 16,800Pa, perfect for picking up messes on hard floors, the V1 Ultra also comes with three-layered noise-canceling technology that ensures noise levels stay below 65dB, about the same level as a dishwasher.\nFuturistic DesignThe transparent design of the body of the vacuum allows users to see the dirt, stains and messes cleaned by the V1 Ultra. The stick vacuum is slender and lightweight and includes an LCD display on the handle for operations and alerts.The V1 Ultra also includes the following design features:\nJetBlade™ Anti-Slip - This feature emits air to dry the floor as it mops, minimizing the risk of slipping on hardwood floors.\nTriple Self-Clean System - The V1 Ultra has a three-fold self-cleaning system that cleans, disinfects and dries the rolling brush, tube and vacuum body at the same time with the press of a button.\nLong-Lasting Battery - This cordless stick vacuum is powered by Anker's industry leading battery technology and offers 82 minutes* of runtime on a single charge.\n*When using Smart Mode. Battery life will vary depending on mode used.\nProduct Specifications\nPricing & AvailabilityThe MACH V1 Ultra is available now in the US with optional Try Now, Buy Later from TryNow on eufy.com with an included accessory package and two bottles of cleaning solution valued over $100. It will be available for general retail purchase on March 15, 2023 on eufy.com, Amazon.com and BestBuy.com for $699.99. The V1 Ultra will be joined by the V1, which includes all of the same features minus Steamwave and Jetblade technologies and will be available for pre-order on March 15.

    "content": " close      Video Funky features on Tesla's Cybertruck Check out the Tesla CybertruckTesla has received a patent for a new type of windshield wiper that it has designed for electric and autonomous cars.The automaker originally filed to protect it in 2019, but the patent was not issued until this January.The \"electromagnetic windshield wiper system\" replaces the traditional setup, where wiper arm s are attached to fixed electric motors that sweep them across an arc.Instead, it features a linear actuator installed at the bottom of the windshield along which a box moves back and forth like a magnetic train.TESLA CYBERTRUCK SPOTTED WITH STRANGE NEW FEATURE  Tesla's patent uses electromagnetic actuators to move the wiper. (Tesla)Tesla says the low friction setup is more energy efficient and less susceptible to wear and corrosion than an electric motor. The arm is attached to the block along with a magnetic rotational actuator that can sweep it as the block moves its base.According to the patent, this allows for more coverage of the glass and can also keep the blade better attached to the surface, especially if it is curved. It also provides for the wiper to be parked horizontally and hidden under the hood when not in use for improved aerodynamics.   Tesla says the system is more energy efficient. (Tesla)Tesla has not shown any vehicles equipped with the design yet. In fact, its next model features the complete opposite.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE FOX NEWS AUTOS NEWSLETTERCybertruck prototypes have been spotted with a single giant wiper attached to the bottom corner of the windshield that sits upright along the driver's side, but still does not appear to be able to reach as much of the glass as would be ideal.  The Cybertruck uses a single wiper attached to the bottom corner of the windshield.  (SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images)\"The wiper is what troubles me most. No easy solution. Deployable wiper that stows in front trunk would be ideal, but complex,\" Tesla's CEO wrote on Twitter last year commenting on the design.  A Cybertruck was photographed w2ith a half-size windshield wiper. (Photographer: Nic Coury/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Another Cybertruck has also been photographed with what appears to be a wiper arm that is half the size and possibly capable of folding like a switchblade, but there has been no official comment on how it works.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The patent is no guarantee the wiper system will be put into production, but Elon Musk said the Cybertruck definitely will be sometime this year, when its wiper design will be finalized.

    "title": "Otter Surpasses 1 Billion Meetings Transcribed and Launches OtterPilot™: The Smart AI Meeting Assistant to Eliminate Note-taking and Automate Meeting Summaries",
    "content": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(\nBUSINESS WIRE\n)--\nOtter.ai\nis launching OtterPilot\n™\n, the smart AI meeting assistant that automates meetings from start to finish to help professionals and teams save time and increase meeting productivity. OtterPilot uses AI to automate the entire meeting process with automated live notes (auto-join and auto-share), automated slide capture, and automated summaries. The launch comes at a significant milestone for the company, with millions of professionals trusting Otter for their meeting notes, Otter has reached the milestone of transcribing over 1 billion meetings.\nIn\nOtter’s recent report on the cost of unnecessary meetings\n, it became clear that professionals and organizations are experiencing an overload of meetings, costing employers millions of dollars and zapping employee morale and productivity.\nNow there is an easy way to collaborate and increase meeting productivity by leveraging the power of an AI assistant to transcribe and summarize meeting takeaways automatically, so not everyone needs to attend every meeting, and those that do can engage without distractions of note-taking. OtterPilot doesn’t just reduce the need to attend every meeting, it also enhances the ones you do attend by saving you time during the meeting and afterwards. OtterPilot eliminates the need to take manual notes during the meeting and sends out a meeting summary that includes images of the meeting slides.\n“AI is helping us in every aspect of our life. Every day when I drive to work, I am helped and inspired by advancements in Tesla’s Autopilot system,” says Sam Liang, co-founder and CEO of Otter.ai. “Similarly, we’ve seen the huge improvements in Otter’s AI capabilities, and now our OtterPilot promises to eliminate note-taking, save time, and improve meeting productivity for our user’s next billion meetings.”\nWhen professionals and teams put their meetings on OtterPilot, this is what it looks like:\nAutomated Meeting Notes\nOtter leverages its proprietary AI to write meeting notes in real time and share them with everyone so they can collaborate during meetings. When connected to a user’s Microsoft or Google calendar, Otter can automatically join virtual meetings. Meeting attendees can view the live transcript, add comments, highlight key points, and even assign action items during the meeting. All of these takeaways are stored alongside the meeting notes for easy recall. Otter can automatically share the Otter notes with those invited to the meeting and/or to a specific group. Why should everyone have to attend every meeting to get the meeting information?\nAutomated Slide Capture\nNow with OtterPilot, users can automatically capture images of slides shared during virtual meetings. Whenever a slide presentation or visual is shared in a virtual meeting, Otter automatically captures it and inserts it into the meeting notes. This way, individuals and teams can easily search for and recall important slides along with the transcript to remember what was shared.\nAutomated Summary\nSave time with Otter’s automated meeting summary - an AI-generated summarization of the key meeting topics. After each meeting, Otter will automatically send a summary to those invited to the meeting and/or directly to an Otter group. Automated summaries are shared via email, with hyperlinks to key moments and slide captures of the meeting.\nOtterPilot features will roll out to users on all plans over the coming days.\nWant to join millions of professionals and organizations and put your meetings on OtterPilot so you can save time and improve team collaboration?\nGive OtterPilot a try for free here\n.\nAnd, if you want to bring Otter to your company, now’s the time.\nContact our sales team here to learn more.\nAbout Otter.ai\nWith over 1B meetings transcribed, Otter.ai is the world’s leading tool for meeting transcription, summarization, and collaboration. Using artificial intelligence, Otter generates real-time automated meeting notes, summaries, and other insights from in-person and virtual meetings - turning meetings into accessible, collaborative, and actionable data that can be shared across teams and organizations. The company is backed by early investors in Google, DeepMind, Zoom, and Tesla.",

    "title": "Ford set to announce $3.5 billion EV battery plant in Michigan, sources say",
    "content": "Michigan has been marketing its marquee, 1,900-acre megasite in Calhoun County near I-69 and I-94 — some 10 miles east of Battle Creek, Mich.\nFord Motor Co. on Monday plans to announce details of a massive electric vehicle battery plant it has decided to build in Marshall, Mich., two people with knowledge of the company's plans told Crain's Detroit Business, an affiliate of Automotive News.\nThe automaker is scheduled to hold a news event at Ford Ion Park in Romulus on Monday, according to an advisory Ford sent Friday.\nThe event will be centered on how Ford \"is working to scale EVs quickly and, ultimately, make them more accessible to customers,\" Ford said.\nRelated Article\nFord-CATL EV battery plant being 'aggressively' pursued by Michigan\nFord, CATL mull battery plant in Mich. amid U.S.-China tensions, report says\nThe announcement will include details about the $3.5 billion factory and 2,500 new jobs in Marshall, the two officials told Crain's.\nThe state has offered $1 billion in incentives, including cash and site development funds, from Michigan's Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, one of the sources said. The account has around $200 million that is not spoken for. Lawmakers will be asked to add $800 million in a supplemental spending bill.\n\"Several Ford executives will be part of the briefing and go more in depth on the plans,\" the Ford advisory said.  A spokesman for the automaker declined to comment beyond the advisory.\nWhile the automaker has not confirmed details of the project, Michigan has been competing for a $3.5 billion lithium iron phosphate factory planned by Ford and Chinese battery giant CATL.\nThe plant would be near the intersection of Interstates 69 and 94, both key commercial corridors.\nThe project would transform a small town in south-central Michigan, some 10 miles from Battle Creek, that has suffered population and job loss in recent years.\nLanding the plant also represents a redemption of sorts for Michigan in its quest to maintain automotive dominance. Ford sent shock waves through the state in 2021 when it announced it would be venturing away from home to invest $11 billion in EV plants and create thousands of jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee.\nThe Ford-CATL plant has not been without controversy.\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said last month that he removed his state from consideration for the factory — Michigan's only publicly known competitor for the plant — because it would serve as a \"Trojan horse\" for China into the U.S., helping the Far East bolster its EV battery dominance and spread its influence.\nFord has not detailed the exact makeup of its partnership with CATL, but a source close to the plan said it would be unlike a traditional joint venture in that Ford would own the plant with employees on its payroll, while CATL would provide battery technology and expertise.\nFord EV targets\nFord is looking to increase its annual global EV production to 600,000 vehicles by late 2023 and 2 million by 2026 as it looks to gain ground on EV market leader Tesla Inc.\nOther automakers are also rushing to set up new plants to support a rapid expansion of EV production.\nGeneral Motors announced last year it would invest $6.5 billion for EV projects in Orion Township, Mich., and the Lansing suburb of Delta Township.\nStellantis NV's move last year to invest more than $2.5 billion and create 1,400 new jobs for an EV plant in Kokomo, Ind., also was a blow to Michigan, but the automaker is searching for a home for another battery plant.\nMichigan is in play for it, and an announcement is expected in the second quarter, a Stellantis spokeswoman confirmed.\nThe Michigan Economic Development Corp. has said it is aggressively competing for other large battery and semiconductor projects.\n\"Michigan is always talking to Ford and any of our large employers,\" MEDC CEO Quentin Messer told Crain's Detroit Business last month. \"We talk in general about making sure that Michigan remains a competitive environment for opportunity.\"",

    "content": "\nHertz Global Holdings Inc. ended last year with far fewer Tesla Inc. vehicles in its fleet than planned when the rental-car company was plotting its late 2021 stock listing.\nIn an annual regulatory filing Tuesday, Hertz said its rental fleet in the Americas peaked at 428,700 vehicles last year, and that Teslas were 11 percent of its fleet. That means Hertz had fewer than 50,000 Teslas in its fleet — less than half the 100,000 the company said it would order by the end of 2022.\nHertz’s October 2021 announcement of its Tesla order sent the electric-vehicle maker’s valuation soaring past $1 trillion for the first time. It also helped drum up interest in the rental-car company, which staged its post-bankruptcy public offering two weeks later.\nRelated Articles\nHertz orders 100,000 Tesla vehicles for end of 2022; Tesla's worth reaches $1 trillion\nHertz Electrifies program launches in Denver\nElon Musk tempered Tesla’s stock rally somewhat days after Hertz made its announcement, tweeting that no contract had been signed and that the EV maker had far more demand than production. Tesla’s market capitalization was $616.2 billion at the close of trading Monday.\nHertz’s filing provides some clues as to why it’s added far fewer Teslas than the car renter said it would order. The first risk factor the company lists pertaining to its EV initiatives is that the strategy depends on the “ability to secure adequate vehicle supply within the time frame we, and our customers, expect.”\nAnother factor that may have come into play: Tesla raised prices on several occasions last year, which might have made acquiring cars costlier than Hertz expected. That’s less of an issue after Tesla slashed prices across its lineup last month.\n \nBloomberg",

    "content": "FinancialNewsMedia.com News Commentary\nPALM BEACH, Fla., Feb. 9, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Lithium is a highly efficient energy storage medium used in virtually all batteries currently powering electric vehicles as well as consumer electronics. Today, lithium is one of the most important minerals when it comes to the production of electric vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries are light, powerful and take less space than other battery types. Tesla, Panasonic and other car manufacturers in the global lithium mining market are betting big on this mineral. In 2021 alone, global lithium production was 100,000 metric tons. By 2025, that number is projected to increase to 200,000 million tons. The global energy transition marathon and its demand for electric vehicles sent lithium demand into overdrive in 2022. Prices for the energy-savvy metal surged around the world over the past year, dragging lithium stocks on a bumpy ride. Now, analysts are reporting some more bearish views for 2023.  A recent report from SkyQuest projected that the Global Lithium mining market, which was valued at USD 340 Million in 2021, is expected to reach a value of USD 494.59 Million by 2028, at a CAGR of 5.5% over the forecast period (2022-2028) and that the US Lithium Mining Market is poised to grow at a sustainable CAGR for the next forecast year.  It continued saying that there is a growing demand for lithium around the world. \"As more carmakers move away from traditional battery types and toward electric vehicles, they will need more lithium-ion batteries in order to power their vehicles.\"  Active Companies in the markets today include \nCentury Lithium Corp. (OTCQX: CYDVF) (TSXV: LCE), \nLithium Americas Corp. (NYSE: LAC) (TSX: LAC), \nStandard Lithium Ltd. (NYSE American: SLI) (TSX-V: SLI), \nAmerican Lithium Corp.

    "content": "The facility, called SEPV Sierra (“Sierra”), demonstrates B2U’s patented EV Pack Storage (EPS) technology, the leading solution for large scale energy storage systems (ESS) utilizing second-life electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The 25MWh of storage capacity is comprised of 1,300 second-life EV battery packsLANCASTER, Calif., Feb.  07, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- B2U Storage Solutions, a leading provider of large-scale energy storage systems using second-life electric vehicle (EV) batteries, announced today that 25MWh of storage capacity is now operational at its SEPV Sierra hybrid solar + storage facility in Lancaster, CA. The project’s storage capacity is comprised of 1,300 reused EV battery packs sourced from Honda and Nissan.  The Sierra hybrid storage facility is interconnected directly to the grid, selling power and grid services into California’s wholesale power market, generating over $1M in revenue in 2022 alone. Sierra initiated commercial operations in 2020, with the team scaling its capacity in phases. This deployment represents the largest operational UL 9540-certified ESS utilizing second-life EV batteries anywhere, on any continent, showcasing B2U’s patented EV Pack Storage (EPS) technology. In addition to deploying Honda and Nissan EV batteries at scale, B2U has successfully tested GM Bolt and Tesla Model 3 battery packs with its EPS system, demonstrating the ability of the EPS system to be configured to operate any EV battery.  “B2U’s EPS technology has been developed to address the challenges of second life in large scale energy storage. EV battery packs are deployed in cabinet enclosures utilizing the pack’s existing battery management system, virtually eliminating repurposing costs.” said Freeman Hall, co-founder and CEO of B2U Storage Solutions. “The EPS system’s Cabinet Controllers connect and disconnect batteries wired in series and parallel strings during charge and discharge cycles so that weaker batteries with lower capacity do not limit the output of stronger batteries. This approach enables our system to achieve efficient energy yield despite the variance in capacity inherent in second life batteries.”  The EPS system provides safe and reliable operation 24/7. In addition to being certified to UL 9540, the system continuously monitors and controls each battery to ensure operating specifications are maintained. EPS cabinet controllers and ancillary equipment sense and manage the internal cabinet environment surrounding each battery pack. To mitigate any potential hazards, battery packs are automatically disconnected if any component deviates from its operating specifications and design limits.  B2U’s energy storage systems deliver a superior CapEx and Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS) advantage. With innovative EPS technology and a team with a proven track record as an independent power producer (IPP), B2U is developing additional projects to add to its operational project portfolio. B2U’s business model to deploy EV batteries in second life applications in large scale ESS is well-suited to the challenges of EV battery reuse, where the available capacity of second life EV batteries is expanding rapidly and may exceed 200 GWh by 2030 based on market analysis conducted by McKinsey.  About B2U Storage SolutionsB2U (“Battery Second Use”) Storage Solutions develops and operates large-scale energy storage systems using second-life EV batteries deployed using our patented EPS technology that eliminates repurposing costs and achieves effective yields from strings of second life EV batteries. B2U’s projects provide electricity and grid services when they’re needed most at a superior Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS).

    "title": "Bidgely Launches Turnkey Electric Vehicle Active Managed Charging for Utilities and Energy Retailers Worldwide",
    "content": "SAN DIEGO--(\nBUSINESS WIRE\n)--\nBidgely\ntoday introduced electric vehicle (EV) Active Managed Charging to its award-winning UtilityAI™\nEV Solution\nat\nDistribuTECH\n, the world’s premier event that connects utilities to future-ready solutions. New Active Managed Charging (also known as direct load control) is now part of Bidgely’s end-to-end EV Solution that also includes: EV Detection and Targeting, EV Passive Managed Charging (behavioral load shift) and EV Grid Analytics. Active Managed Charging can be launched in just weeks without data integration as a turn-key standalone application. Over 25 OEMs are available for data connection with seven available for active control: Ford, Hyundai, Jaguar, Land Rover, Toyota, Tesla, VW.\nAs the industry’s only complete and proven approach to EV engagement and management, Bidgely’s EV Solution accurately targets high-peak charging customers for incentive programs using the company’s\npatented\nAI-powered EV disaggregation technology. By delivering 90 percent or better accuracy in identifying customers with EVs on the grid and providing behind-the-meter visibility into their charging behaviors, Bidgely’s EV Solution provides utilities the ability to better target their highest-value customers for load-shift programs, reducing program costs from an average of ~$225/kW to ~$65/kW.\n“The EV revolution is going to have a rapid and profound impact on load pressure, grid resilience and decarbonization. This will mean that utilities will need to take a smart and integrated approach to EV engagement and management, at a pace they have not historically moved,” said Bidgely CEO Abhay Gupta. “The only way to do this rapidly at the scale this revolution demands is by harnessing the power of data and AI to empower smarter energy decisions in an integrated and connected way.”\nWhile other EV solutions rely on a patchwork of partners and technology that drive up costs, complexity, and time-to-value, the introduction of Active Managed Charging means Bidgely now provides an end-to-end solution for the smart integration of EVs onto the grid. This approach helps utilities to:\nIdentify\nall EVs in a utility’s territory using Bidgely's patented EV disaggregation technology;\nRecruit\neconomically at scale with Bidgely's omni-channel customer engagement solution, recognized as a leader in\nIDC's MarketScape\nreport for digital customer engagement solutions;\nTarget\nthe specific EVs causing congestion based on advanced grid analytics; and\nOptimize\ncharging of millions of EVs to help grid resilience, while offering the best value charging for consumers.\nBidgely has partnered with a range of utilities to help them realize sustainable load shift through the intersection of AI and EV consumer behavior influence. A tier one investor-owned utility reported over 90 percent accuracy in EV detection and estimation, with a\n75 percent load-shift\nfrom on-peak to off-peak. Now, 97 percent of all EV charging is occurring off-peak.\nTo learn more about Bidgely’s new EV Active Managed Charging, visit:\nbidgely.com/resources/ev-active-managed-charging-with-telematics-solution-brief\nBidgely at DistribuTECH 2023\nVisitors to DistribuTECH can join Bidgely at the event alongside notables like Duke Energy, Ameren, Southern California Edison, the Department of Energy and more in a series of live sessions and demonstrations. Attendees of yesterday’s SECC 2023 Best Practices Awards ceremony, where Bidgely’s EV Solution was honored as the winner for the Smart Energy Innovation category in collaboration with\nUnited Illuminating\n, can also schedule a meeting with Bidgely at DistribuTECH by visiting:\nbidgely.com/events/dtech\n.\nAbout Bidgely\nBidgely is an AI-powered SaaS Company accelerating a clean energy future by enabling energy companies and consumers to make data-driven energy-related decisions.

    "content": "Leading investors including Two Sigma Ventures, Founders Fund and Threshold Ventures back Freeform to revolutionize additive manufacturing \nHAWTHORNE, Calif., Feb. 1, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Freeform, a cutting-edge metal 3D printing company founded by accomplished leaders and engineers from SpaceX, is proud to announce its official launch out of stealth. The company is deploying software-defined, autonomous printing factories around the world, bringing on-demand production to mainstream industries and enabling the future of innovation. Freeform's advanced printing technology eliminates historical production barriers and allows manufacturers in any industry to quickly go from idea to volume production. \nHistorically, manufacturing limitations and a heavy reliance on human labor have fundamentally limited the pace of innovation and resulted in long and costly efforts to scale production. While 3D printing had promised to overcome these challenges, printing at scale had yet to be realized - incumbent technology is too slow, the cost and effort of owning and operating machines are too high, and even the best systems on the market today are unable to consistently produce high-quality parts quickly. \nFreeform's autonomous printing factories and manufacturing-as-a-service business model solve these challenges. Its proprietary technology stack brings the scalability of software to physical production by leveraging advanced sensing, real-time controls, and data-driven learning in a scalable factory architecture. As a result, the company is producing digitally-verified, high-quality parts at unprecedented speed and cost. This breakthrough approach enables all industries to innovate faster by leveraging additive manufacturing to produce parts at mass production scale. \n\"While at SpaceX, I leveraged metal 3D printing to accelerate the development of numerous rocket engines. We were innovating in ways that were not possible before and accelerating our trajectory toward the future; however, we ultimately realized that it was impossible to print at production scale using even the best current technologies. We founded Freeform to solve this problem and to make this transformative technology available to all industries, giving anyone the ability to rapidly take an idea and produce it at scale,\" said Erik Palitsch, Co-Founder and CEO of Freeform. \"We're bringing the best talent on the planet together to disrupt the manufacturing industry, and with our recent fundraise, we're excited to scale production capacity to make printing at scale available to all industries.\" \nFreeform is already helping customers to innovate and get products to market faster. \"As Embark brings autonomous trucking technology to market, we need the ability to seamlessly scale up from prototype to production,\" said Brandon Connors, Head of Programs and Manufacturing at Embark Trucks, a leading developer of autonomous technology for the trucking industry. \"That means sourcing commercial-grade metal parts on short timelines, consistently and at a practical cost. Freeform's printing service enables us to meet our manufacturing needs, improves supply chain reliability, and gives us the ability to change designs without impacting delivery time, so that we can accelerate the deployment of our technology.\" \nIn addition, Freeform is enabling customers to easily scale from initial designs into high-volume production. \"Freeform offers us the ability to scale up from prototype to production.\" said Nick Doucette, Chief Operations Officer at Ursa Major. Ursa Major is an American aerospace company that works with Freeform for the manufacturing of rocket engine parts. \"Freeform's printing service gives us the ability to change designs rapidly without impacting production cost or delivery time. We are able to get consistent, high-quality metal parts in days instead of weeks.\" \nIn an unparalleled pace of development, Freeform has gone from initial concept to deploying its first production-scale printing factory in just a couple of years, and has paying customers across advanced energy, automotive, aerospace, and industrial sectors. \n\"Freeform has revolutionized the additive approach,\" said Scott Nolan, Investor from Founders Fund. \"Others have tried addressing one component or problem at a time, like thermal stress, but no one else has rethought the entire architecture and approach. Freeform has created more flexibility for how parts are printed, and their cost-effective model has opened up a whole new class of 3D-printable parts.\" \nPartner at Two Sigma Ventures, Dusan Perovic, who led Freeform's most recent round similarly affirms that Freeform is the right company to scale metal printing for the first time. \"Freeform represents a quantum leap forward for additive manufacturing. And perhaps just as importantly, Erik, TJ, and the team are the right people to bring this technology to a range of industries–blending expertise and engineering savvy, with a mindset of constant improvement.\"\nFreeform's world-class team comprises industry leaders from the likes of SpaceX, Velo3D, Carbon, Tesla, and Apple, who have successfully overcome the challenges of disruption. Freeform has raised $45M to date and is backed by leading Silicon Valley investors including Two Sigma Ventures, Founders Fund, and Threshold Ventures. Mo Islam, Partner at Threshold, and Dusan Perovic, Partner at Two Sigma, are on Freeform's Board of Directors. \nAbout Freeform\nHeadquartered in Los Angeles, CA, Freeform deploys software-defined, autonomous metal 3D printing factories around the world, bringing on-demand production to mainstream industries at any scale. Its advanced printing technology and manufacturing-as-a-service model eliminate historical production barriers by enabling manufacturers in any industry to quickly go from idea to volume production.

    "content": "Rental car company Hertz Global Holdings has launched the Hertz Electrifies program — an initiative in partnership with U.S. city mayors aimed at streamlining the transition to electric vehicles.\nThe program consists of \"five pillars,\" according to a statement released Thursday, including bolstering EV fleet numbers and charging infrastructure, education and job creation, expansive economic opportunity, community engagement and city planning analysis.\nThe role of EVs in the future of transportation is \"why Hertz is investing in the largest electric vehicle rental fleet in North America,\" Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in the statement. The fleet includes Tesla, Polestar and General Motors models.\nHertz Electrifies is launching in Denver in partnership with Mayor Michael Hancock, bringing up to 5,200 EV rentals to the city and installing a mix of Level 2 and EV fast-charging stations at Denver International Airport and Hertz locations. The Denver arm of the program is a partnership site with BP Pulse, supporting the installation of public-access EV chargers in neighborhoods in the city.\nRide-share drivers will be able to make use of the program as part of its goal to expand economic opportunities, renting \"electric vehicles with flexible contracts,\" according to the statement.\nAdditional elements of the program include community engagement, with the goal of increasing access to EVs and other vehicles in underserved areas, and support for educational opportunities in the EV field. This includes a partnership with the Denver Youth Employment program to offer summer jobs, as well as EVs, training and supplies for the auto certificate program at a local technical high school.\nThrough Hertz Electrifies, partnering cities will have access to telematics data from the Hertz fleet to use in charging infrastructure planning.",

    "title": "UnitedLex Reveals Major Auto Brands Overspend $2-4M Annually on Non-Strategic Patents",
    "content": "NEW YORK--(\nBUSINESS WIRE\n)--\nUnitedLex\n, a leading data and professional services company specializing in litigation, intellectual property, contracts, compliance, and legal operations, has announced the release of two new reports examining the financial impact of patent lapse strategies for major automotive manufacturers.\nAccording to its analysis, UnitedLex reports that the average patent lapse rate for auto manufacturers is approximately 18%. Assessing patents through objective data analysis reveals otherwise obscured opportunities that help businesses meet objectives and realize millions of dollars in shareholder value. This includes divesting and monetizing patents no longer core to business objectives and allowing commercially immaterial patents to lapse.\n“In today’s precarious economic environment, strategic lapsing of patents can provide automotive companies and their patent teams more control that can lead to significant near-term cost savings,” said Joe Dearing, Executive Vice President, Global Intellectual Property, UnitedLex. “However, our analysis shows a number of automotive companies continue to maintain patent assets for dated and off-strategy technologies.”\nThe UnitedLex Automotive U.S. Patent Lapse Analysis, vol. 1\nanalyzes Tesla’s evolving approach to patent lapse management and how its increasing patent retention rates run counter to public comments made by Elon Musk, the company’s high-profile leader.\nThe UnitedLex Automotive U.S. Patent Lapse Analysis, vol. 2\nfocuses on many of the world’s largest automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)--including Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota--whose massive U.S. patent portfolios dwarf Tesla’s and represent billions of dollars of shareholder value.\nKey findings from Volume 1:\nDespite Elon Musk declaring “patents are for the weak,” over the last decade, Tesla expanded its electric vehicle patent portfolio, amassing approximately 3,000 globally and 1,000 in the United States through 2021.\nTesla is increasingly investing in patents, filing at a consistent pace, and retaining patents annually at rates of 98-100%.\nCounter to Tesla’s strategy, Ford has increasingly embraced strategic lapsing over the last five to seven years.\nKey findings from Volume 2:\nWith an average lapse rate of 27%, Honda realized $28M in savings over the last decade validating a more optimized approach to defensive patent maintenance.\nIn the last five years, with a patent lapse rate of just 14%, Hyundai spent $16M in maintenance fees on U.S. patents but faces more than $54M in total renewal costs due over the next five years, more than a 3x increase.\nToyota spent approximately $36M in U.S. maintenance fees over the last five years but faces roughly $96M to maintain its entire U.S. patent portfolio over the next five years, a more than 2x increase from approximately $7M to approximately $14M per year.\nVolkswagen and Toyota spent the last five years trading places as the world’s largest auto brand based on vehicles sold, but Volkswagen does not make the top five list with its portfolio of approximately 6,400 U.S. patents.\nBoth GM and Ford are facing significantly higher maintenance costs over the next five years of more than $12M per year for each company.\nThe reports are part of the\nUnitedLex Automotive U.S. Patent Lapse Series\nwhich will conclude with a third report analyzing the U.S. automotive industry through the lens of patent data.

    "title": "Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) Technologies and Global Markets Report 2022 with Profiles of Leading Players - Agc, Ertex Solartechnik, Kaneka, Novergy Energy Solutions, Solarwindow, Tesla - ResearchAndMarkets.com",
    "content": "DUBLIN--(\nBUSINESS WIRE\n)--The\n\"Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV): Technologies and Global Markets\"\nreport has been added to\nResearchAndMarkets.com's\noffering.\nIn this report, the market has been segmented based on technology, application, end user and geography. The report provides an overview of the global BIPV market and analyses market trends. Using 2021 as the base year, the report provides estimated market data for the forecast period, 2022-2027.\nBuildings today are a leading global consumer of energy, and this trend is likely to continue well into the future, primarily driven by economic and population growth. This trend has been increasingly recognized by a multitude of countries worldwide.\nDifferent governments at the federal, state and local levels are increasing their investment in green energy technologies for new and existing buildings as a means of achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets. Consequently, energy efficiency in buildings has evolved into a major factor of the green movement in recent years.\nBIPVs make up a small but increasingly noticeable component of the global PV market. Some BIPV applications are emerging as major growth segments that will likely reach gigawatt-scale annual sales within a decade. When annual capacity installations are totaled, the entire BIPV sector is found to already be beyond the gigawatt level of annual capacity.\nUnlike the rapid progress made in building PV capacity with utility-scale power plants, no feasible method exists for complete vertical integration with BIPV projects in all existing and planned buildings. For this, companies need partners, affiliates, alliances, visionaries and champions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant change in consumer behavior and demand, affected purchasing patterns, re-routed supply chains, complicated the dynamics of current market forces and involved significant interventions of governments. Just like any other market, the BIPV market was impacted by the pandemic in 2020.\nTwo types of construction markets can include BIPV components: new-builds and retrofits. The economic upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic severely depressed new construction in many regions of the world. In developed economies, renovations and retrofits will show more significant opportunities in the coming years since those projects, always necessary, are more likely to be eligible for public financial incentives and potential developer participation.\nThe silicon used to fabricate solar cells is either crystalline (single-crystal or multi-crystal) or amorphous. Presently, c-Si and multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) rigid modules are the dominant BIPV products, along with amorphous silicon (a-Si) flexible modules. However, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) technologies are growing rapidly as well.\nThe use of c-Si and mc-Si will change rapidly-and be used in ways that standard rigid modules cannot. The arrival of CIGS into the market, followed closely by the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and organic PV (OPV) products, will encourage an entirely new method and process of thinking about how to build, clad and color buildings.\nA building consists of an outside shell, an inside, sides and a top. Nearly all PV applications involve the integration of the PV component in an exterior building component. An integrated PV product physically replaces a component and then serves both that component's original function and generates electricity. The table below provides an overview of the various regional markets.\nRevenue forecasts for this period are segmented based on technology, application, end user and geography. Market values have been estimated based on the total revenue of BIPV providers.\nThe report covers the market for BIPV with regard to the user base across different regions. It also highlights major trends and challenges that affect the market and the vendor landscape. The report estimates the global market for BIPV in 2021 and provides projections for the expected market size through 2027.\nThe report also focuses on the major driving trends and challenges that affect the market and the vendor landscape.

We believe opportunity and education should go hand-in-hand and giving our clients the option to expand their portfolios as well as gain even more insight is second nature to our education-first approach.\"\nTrading Expert\nThe iFOREX Trading Expert feature provides a unique opportunity for traders to gain valuable experience by watching an industry expert open and close CFD trading deals in real-time while sharing live commentary on their individual trading strategies. Using elements of both fundamental and technical analysis, iFOREX's Trading Expert enables clients with the kind of insight and focus that could help them make more informed trading decisions of their own.\nNon-Leveraged Instruments\niFOREX offers a wide selection of non-leveraged financial instruments to its Latin American market, intended for both large-volume traders as well as medium-small traders seeking investments with lower risk. The lineup includes shares and cryptocurrencies such as Apple, Intel, Tesla, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many more. Non-leveraged instruments are executed at a 1:1 ratio (margin:deal size) and offer investors with long-term goals more opportunity by lowering market exposure and portfolio risk while doing away with overnight financing fees on long positions, thereby increasing the time they can hold an instrument without accruing maintenance or holding fees.\nFor over 25 years, iFOREX has remained one of the largest and most respected firms in the Fintech industry, emerging early on as an industry leader in technological innovation and with a dedication to trust and excellence. \"Our ultimate goal is to evolve in a way that benefits our clients both old and new, and regardless of their experience level. We're a broker that empowers traders to grow,\" added the spokesperson.\nSOURCE iFOREX",

    "title": "A New Global Standard for at-a-Distance RF Wireless Charging is Here",
    "content": "The AirFuel Alliance has announced the release of AirFuel RF, a new global standard for wireless power transfer (WPT) with the potential to give designers more freedom in designing and implementing new IoT devices. This news comes at a welcome time as IoT devices become more commonplace in both the home and workplace, with an expected 22 billion devices by 2025.\nWith an ever-increasing number of devices, providing power is no longer a simple task. Batteries offer an on-device solution but require manual replacement when depleted, while traditional power cables can quickly create a rat’s nest of cords. Wireless power offers a viable method of powering devices without batteries or cords but is typically limited in range or efficiency. However, with the release of the AirFuel RF standard, wireless power in the IoT space has suddenly become an attractive potential solution.\nThis article overviews the AirFuel Alliance and the AirFuel RF standard alongside the technical backbone that makes AirFuel RF an effective wireless power source. In addition, we'll discuss some target use cases for AirFuel RF to help designers understand how they may incorporate the standard in the next generation of IoT designs.\nFrom Tesla to Today\nEver since Nikola Tesla built his tower in Pikes Peak, Colorado, engineers have been chasing the dream of universal wireless power. While we now understand the physics behind Tesla’s experiments, we also know that WPT is not as simple as erecting Tesla coils throughout cities. To develop wireless power that is both efficient and effective, a group of organizations formed the AirFuel Alliance with the goal of standardizing WPT.\nAt the time of writing, there are numerous mechanisms through which power may be transferred wirelessly. The most common method relies on electromagnetic (EM) induction and is typically used in applications where power must only be transferred over millimeter-scale distances. EM induction relies on two coils, one in the source and one in the load, to transfer energy in the form of magnetic fields.\nAnother common form of WPT is radio frequency (RF) transmission, which is commonly used to send information globally. While it is true that RF does have the ability to send power across the world, it is typically not sufficient to power a load at long distances and relies on active amplifiers to extract any useful information. RF-based short-range wireless power devices have existed for some time but, until now, have not been united under any one standard.\nAirFuel RF: Extending the Reach of WPT\nSince it’s often not practical to confine devices within a few millimeters of a power source, the AirFuel Alliance developed the AirFuel RF standard to unify RF-based WPT development under a single standard. Quantitative results of the standard are still unavailable, but the AirFuel Alliance has reported promising metrics such as multi-device charging “several feet” away from the charger without requiring precise placement.\nWhile high-power applications such as wireless mobile phone charging are still out of reach for AirFuel RF, low-power devices common in the IoT space are poised to benefit greatly from the standard since low power can be quickly transferred and harvested. In addition, the AirFuel RF standard is scalable, ensuring an easy deployment regardless of the environment.\nPhasing in AirFuel RF\nAs with any new standard, time will be the ultimate test for AirFuel RF to determine its effectiveness as a low-power energy source. One major unknown for the standard is efficiency since transmitting RF energy over long distances inherently increases wasted power. It’s also unlikely that AirFuel RF can work as a standalone system because prolonged power loss at the source may create a system-wide shutdown. Organizations interested in testing the AirFuel RF standard in a practical setting may consider using the evaluation kit from AirFuel.\nRegardless, expanding the range of WPT can provide a ubiquitous power source that designers can use to shrink existing designs or spark new innovations. As practical results using AirFuel RF become widely available, designers can weigh the benefits and tradeoffs of the standard to decide if cutting the cord is right for their projects.",

    "content": "COLMAR, Pa., Dec.  07, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dorman Products, Inc. (NASDAQ:DORM) announced today the release of 279 new light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicle repair parts and components, nearly half of which are first to the aftermarket, giving retailers, distributors, professional repair shops and vehicle owners greater access to the solutions they need.    New this month is a Dorman OE FIX™ engine crankcase vent valve, also known as a PCV assembly, for more than 100,000 Audi and Volkswagen vehicles in North America (264-927). The valve covers on popular Passat, Touareg, CC and Q7 vehicles with V6 engines have an integrated PCV valve. When the diaphragm rips, shops and consumers were previously forced to purchase an entire new valve cover assembly just to replace a small piece. This kit helps professionals and vehicle owners reduce their repair cost by directly replacing the failure-prone valve, and it includes a new valve cover gasket for a convenient, complete repair. It also expands on Dorman’s already industry-leading line of valve cover solutions, including an additional nine new valve covers being released this month.    Another new and improved solution this month is an OE FIX steering wobble kit for a decade’s worth of JK Jeep Wranglers, from 2007 to 2018 (SWS96305RD). Jeeps can experience an infamous \"wobble\" that is typically the result of a road shock that's transmitted directly through worn components in the original front suspension. This kit is designed to reduce the susceptibility of the Wrangler's solid front axle to this condition and help ensure more predictable and consistent steering performance. Dorman’s kit has a differentiated approach that includes three distinct fixes. First, key wear items are replaced with more durable solutions, including upgraded ball joints that boast an oversized ball and convenient grease fittings for easy service during routine lube jobs. Second, the kit includes a specially redesigned track bar that alters the steering geometry. And third, the kit includes a heavy-duty steering damper and quick-disconnect sway bar links for even better control and articulation when drivers go rock-crawling or mudding. Dorman previously released a similar kit for earlier TJ-model Jeeps.    Dorman also continues to grow and innovate in the heavy-duty market. New this month is an OE FIX coolant sensor for Mack refuse trucks (924-5516XD). The original equipment coolant level sensor on certain Macks may provide inaccurate data that sends the engine into limp mode, causing costly vehicle downtime. This OE FIX solution more consistently and accurately monitors coolant levels by using a magnetic float with a larger swept area and a stainless steel shaft potted with epoxy, helping drivers and fleet managers keep trucks running longer.    Dorman continues to accelerate growth and investments in the emerging technology landscape, based on its commitment to be a coverage leader in this area. Dorman currently covers more than 1 billion repair opportunities with its extensive lineup of emerging technology parts that span across complex electronics, EV/hybrid powertrain and non-powertrain categories. New this month is an OE FIX door handle repair kit for 2012-2021 Tesla S vehicles (601-650). The original equipment exterior door handle assembly on these popular electric vehicles can fail to present the handle when the weak internal paddle gear breaks or the microswitch wiring becomes damaged from constant flexing. This OE FIX exterior door handle repair kit features a stronger and longer-lasting stainless steel paddle gear, new microswitch, and the fasteners and O-rings required to make a complete repair that will help prevent future handle issues caused by the same failure-prone factory components.    Other new solutions this month include:    20 new upgraded coil springs designed to provide a 35 percent to 70 percent increase in load handling capacity, custom-engineered to improve ride quality, reduce driver fatigue, and improve handling on many pickup trucks, SUVs, RVs, plow trucks, vans and more.A new air suspension upfit kit for 2009 to 2014 Ford F-150s (949-044), an add-on solution designed to help compensate for a sagging suspension by providing additional support to maintain factory-like ride height and handling. The patent-pending solution includes air springs that feature a fail-safe design that includes a more substantial internal coil spring, and the kit includes all the components required for a complete, straightforward installation with no drilling, welding, or special tools required.

    "content": "One of the most active CNCF projects, Argo, is trusted by industry leaders such as Adobe, BlackRock, Capital One, Google, Intuit, Peloton, Tesla, and Ticketmaster \nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 6, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, announced today the graduation of Argo, which will join other graduated projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Envoy.\nThe Argo Project enables organizations to declaratively deploy and run cloud native applications and workflows on Kubernetes using GitOps. Created and open sourced in 2017 by Applatix, which was acquired by Intuit, the Argo project was accepted into the CNCF Incubator in April 2020. Intuit, along with BlackRock – which contributed Argo Events to the project – have been heavily involved in the development and cultivation of the project and the community.\nArgo consists of four Kubernetes-native sub-projects, including Argo Workflows, Argo Events, Argo CD, and Argo Rollouts. Argo Workflows enables the creation of complex parallel workflows as Kubernetes resources and is used in many different use cases from CI/CD pipelines to machine learning workflows. Argo Events provides declarative management of event-based dependencies and triggers for Kubernetes resources, including Argo Workflows, based on various event sources. The other two sub-projects, Argo CD and Argo Rollouts, help engineers understand, adopt, and use Kubernetes as well as make GitOps best practices significantly more approachable for teams who want to adopt it. These tools can be used independently, but there is great benefit in using them together to create and operate complex applications at scale.\n\"Graduating from the CNCF Incubator requires a project to reach difficult-to-attain milestones, significant adoption, diversity, and sustained growth,\" said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the CNCF. \"Argo has shown itself to be an important piece of the cloud native technology stack and GitOps movement, we are thrilled to see it graduate.\"\nArgo is actively used in production by over 350 organizations – a 250% increase since joining the CNCF Incubator – including Adobe, Blackrock, Capital One, Google, Intuit, PagerDuty, Peloton, Snyk, Swisscom, Tesla, and Volvo and in the latest CNCF user survey, over 50% of respondents said they were running Argo in production, or evaluating it. With 2300 companies and 8000 individuals contributing to the project, it's one of the strongest and most diverse communities in CNCF.\n\"We started the Argo project after realizing the limitless potential of adding new capabilities to Kubernetes through its powerful extension mechanism. Argo Workflows and Events has enabled data scientists to leverage Kubernetes clusters in unforeseen and exciting new ways. Meanwhile, DevOps engineers have fallen in love with how Argo CD and Rollouts brought both simplicity and power to the application delivery experience,\" said Jesse Suen, Argo Project co-creator, co-founder, and CTO at Akuity. \"We are honored that Argo is now categorized among other incredible CNCF projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Envoy, and incredibly proud of what our amazing community has accomplished.\"\n\"Argo has passed every test the CNCF has thrown at it. Graduation means Argo meets the highest standards for security, user adoption, and governance. By every measure, Argo is a mature, sustainable, and successful open source project,\" said Dan Garfield, Argo project maintainer, chief open source officer, and co-founder of Codefresh. \"More than graduation, our incredible community shows just how powerful and mature the Argo project is.\"\n\"Cloud native and open source technologies are a core pillar of Intuit's infrastructure, enabling us to increase overall development velocity at scale,\" said Pratik Wadher, senior vice president of product development at Intuit. \"Argo has also been a critical part of this journey, from our humble beginnings where we created the Argo Project at Applatix to how we leverage and maintain today's multi-faceted tooling at Intuit. We believe in the power of open collaboration and are committed to our role as users and maintainers. It's humbling and inspiring to be a part of this passionate and engaged community.\"\n\"As an early contributor to Argo, we saw the potential the technology had for enabling organizations to more easily take a GitOps approach to both OpenShift application and cluster deployments,\" said Joe Fernandes, vice president and general manager of hybrid cloud platforms at Red Hat. \"We've seen the project evolve to further bring together developers and operations and address use cases faced by enterprise customers in multi-cluster Kubernetes environments. Argo is an integral part of the Red Hat OpenShift ecosystem and the foundation for OpenShift GitOps and we look forward to continuing to support and contribute to the project beyond graduation.\"\nEnd User Support\n\"At Adobe, we're using all four Argo projects to drive various workflows, including CI/CD, just-in-time provisioning, cluster updates, and much more,\" said Aya Ivtsan, principal scientist at Adobe. \"Argo's modularity and versatility, along with its vibrant community, have helped us provide flexible and extensible solutions to Adobe's developers. We are excited to see Argo reaching graduation status in CNCF and looking forward to our continued collaboration with the Argo community!\"\n\"When BlackRock decided to write an event-based system for Kubernetes to fill a gap we saw in the industry, we knew we wanted to donate it to an existing high-quality open source organization, where cloud native systems were being built and there was a like-minded community. The Argo Project was quickly identified as the organization and the community we wanted to work with,\" said Mike Bowen senior principal engineer and OSPO director at BlackRock. \"Working with the Argo community to build Argo Events has been a catalyst to many follow-on opportunities for BlackRock within the Argo Project, the Linux Foundation and CNCF at large and has yielded many positive product and business outcomes across our cloud native estate. For example, we went from running imperative shell scripts deploying hundreds of applications across tens of clusters to using Argo CD. Argo CD provides the scalability and robustness to deploy thousands of applications across hundreds of clusters using many Kubernetes distributions.\" \n\"Argo tools are used extensively by multiple teams at CERN,\" said Ricardo Rocha, computing engineer at CERN. \"Argo CD has made multi-cluster and application management easy with GitOps, speeding up the deployment process and improving overall service availability. With Argo Workflows, physicists have gained a new way to manage their full analysis code declaratively. We're excited about Argo's graduation and look forward to what's coming next.\"\nTo graduate, Argo met the rigorous standards required of a mature and stable project, including a clear governance and committer process, healthy growth and adoption, and high standards for security and compliance. Argo achieved and maintains an OpenSSF Best Practices Badge and went through a third-party security audit in July 2022.\nAdditional Resources\nArgo GitHub \nProject website\nFollow Argo Proj on Twitter\nFollow Argo Proj on LinkedIn\nJoin the Argo conversation on Slack\nAdditional Argo resources\nCNCF Newsletter\nCNCF Twitter\nCNCF Blog\nAbout Cloud Native Computing Foundation\nCloud native computing empowers organizations to build and run scalable applications with an open source software stack in public, private, and hybrid clouds.

    "content": "The new VW Group CEO Oliver Blume and Brand CEO Thomas Schäfer continue to readjust the plans of their predecessors. According to a media report, the design draft for the new electric flagship Trinity has fallen through – the model will be redesigned.\nAs reported by German Automobilwoche, the previous body design of a flat electric limousine is said to have not gone down well with the new VW top management – Trinity was planned under the then group boss Herbert Diess and the ex-brand boss Ralf Brandstätter. “Because of the better opportunities on the market”, the newly planned Trinity model is to move “significantly more in the direction of an SUV”, according to the report.\nWith the SUV body – or an SUV-like crossover model – one will indeed accept cutbacks in aerodynamics (and thus range). However, it is important to focus on “what the customers want”. Another guideline of the new VW leadership: Trinity will still come with the best technology. But no longer with the best drag coefficient. That was one of Brandstätter’s goals: the cW value of the Trinity should be better than that of the ID.7, which is supposed to have a cW value of 0.23.\nHowever, Blume and Schäfer’s criticism was probably not only about the body concept itself: “Too well-behaved, too inconspicuous and far too little distinctive” was the limousine design, according to the report. VW has had a lot of success in the past with rather inconspicuous and hardly polarising designs like the Golf or Passat. Whether only the flagship model is to become significantly more striking or whether the entire brand design is to be redesigned is still open. At least for the old Trinity concept, work on the bodywork has been stopped for the time being.\nThe German publication Automobilwoche also states that nothing has been decided yet. So it seems that a re-planning is underway, but which concept will be realised in the end is still open. A Trinity SUV was also previously planned – after the flat sedan. Whether these plans will now be reversed or a crossover model with borrowings from both body concepts will replace both models is not clear from the report.\nTrinity is not the first model to be re-planned. The upcoming VW ID.2, whose design with retro borrowings was presented at the IAA 2021 as the study ID. Life at the IAA 2021, also failed at Schäfer and had to be redesigned. However, the new design was probably approved.\nIt had already become apparent that not everything was going well with the Trinity project. According to other reports, Blume internally questioned the planned Trinity plant in Wolfsburg-Warmenau. Instead of a completely new electric car plant on a greenfield site, the model is apparently to be built within the existing main plant. A modern plant was one of Herbert Diess’ core projects in order to compete with Tesla in terms of production – in his view, the old, grown Wolfsburg plant was not suitable with its complex logistics and space conditions.\nWith the new planning for production and now apparently also for the vehicle itself, the original schedule can hardly be kept. Instead of 2026, the model will not be launched until 2028, according to “Automobilwoche”. Manager Magazin” recently reported that the launch of the Trinity will even be postponed by about four years to 2030.\nHowever, it is not only the body design that is responsible for the postponement of the Trinity’s market launch, but also the software. Since the flagship model is not only to be based on the new SSP platform, but is also to be the first model to receive Level 4 software 2.0 for autonomous driving, the software is at least as important a factor as the hardware – without it, nothing works with the Trinity.\nThe new Volkswagen boss Oliver Blume is preparing a new software strategy to keep the company fit for the future. Blume plans to present the key points of the strategy at a supervisory board meeting on 15 December, the Handelsblatt has learned from company sources. Since the prestige project Trinity and the associated software 2.0 have been delayed, the existing software architectures 1.1 and 1.2 must be further developed. Thus, software version 1.2, which is especially important for the premium brands Porsche and Audi, will now be upgraded for a term until the end of the decade and will be given a new name: Software Premium.\nWith reporting by Sebastian Schaal, Germany.\n (Trinity),  (software, both in German)",

    "content": "Tesla has announced the start of deliveries of its Semi electric truck at an official event – five years after its presentation and three years after the originally announced start of deliveries. The most important confirmed news is that the battery can be charged with up to 1 megawatt thanks to a 1,000-volt system.\nNot too many details were revealed beyond that. Like the plaid versions of the Model S and Model X, the Tesla Semi uses a drive system consisting of three electric motors, one of which is used for the most efficient constant speed and the other two for acceleration. The battery is expected to take the electric truck 500 miles (about 800 kilometres) when fully loaded without stopping to charge – something Tesla claims to have recently demonstrated.\nHowever, Tesla still does not name a price for the Semi and official information about the payload, the battery capacity, the performance of the motors and the date of the start of large-scale production is still missing. Tesla started production of the first units in October.\nAs expected, Tesla delivered the first electric trucks to long-time reservation holder Pepsi. In the USA, the Semi falls into truck class 8 with a gross vehicle weight of up to 80,000 lbs (about 36.3 tonnes). Electric trucks are allowed to exceed this limit by another 2,000 lbs, which translates to 37.2 tonnes. Tesla stated a few days ago that it had completed the 500 miles with an 82,000 lbs semi – i.e. fully loaded.\nA big question mark, however, remains the dead weight of the semi, which determines the payload. As the US portal Electrek explains, Class 8 trucks can weigh between 12,000 and 25,000 lbs (around 5.4 to 11.3 tonnes), and the payload varies accordingly.\nThe price of the electric truck is also still unclear. Shortly after the prototype was unveiled in 2017, Tesla quoted an “expected base price” of $150,000 for the basic Semi model. At the time, $180,000 was quoted for a range-extended variant and €200,000 for the ‘Founders Series’ version. Since then, Tesla has not commented on its price expectations.\nThere were no major surprises at the presentation, however, one piece of news that was not yet known was that the electric pickup Cybertruck planned for the end of 2023 will probably adopt the charging technology of the Semi, meaning that it will also be able to be charged with up to 1 MW in the future.\n, ,  (Cybertruck)",

    "content": "The company who pioneered cars-on-demand is expanding its Tesla subscription model for Economy, Sedan and SUV fleets, providing first of its kind solution to all transportation needs\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 1, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Kyte (), the company pioneering cars-on-demand for daily, weekly or monthly use, today announced the launch of its new subscription service for extended vehicle access. Building on the success of their Tesla program, the new product will be available for Economy, Sedan and SUV fleets across Kyte's 14 U.S. markets. This service follows the company's recent announcement of $60M Series B growth equity financing in November and its expansion into Ft. Lauderdale in September.\nKyte's latest offering is a major milestone in the company's aggressive, yet sustainable product and platform growth strategy and an important step toward building a model beyond short term mobility solutions. The introduction of Kyte's subscription service provides convenient and flexible access while bypassing the hassle and commitment of traditional car ownership. Each of the 3, 6, 12-month plans include registration, maintenance, roadside assistance, and Kyte's signature front door delivery and pick-up. Monthly pricing begins at $519.\n\"Our mission is to unlock the freedom to go places, and including subscriptions for all four vehicle classes ensures a solution that fits everyone,\" said Erik Zahnlecker, Director of New Products. \"Similar to what Lyft and UBER have done for rideshare, we aim to completely disrupt the transportation space and make people think twice when looking to buy a car. Our customer-first, car-on-demand access is unmatched and we have yet to see competition who comes close to delivering on this promise.\"\nKyte's subscription service not only addresses the desire for something more reliable and affordable without long-term commitment but it also alleviates the concerns of rising interest rates  that significantly affect standard car leases and dealer financing. By bridging the gap between car rental and car ownership, Kyte is redefining the limitations of the transportation industry and will continue expanding into new product categories and new vehicle classes.\nMore information about Kyte's suite of subscription services including full pricing and associated fees can be found HERE.\nAbout Kyte\nKyte is reinventing the mobility market and is on a mission to \"unlock the freedom to go places.\" Kyte delivers cars on demand to people's doors for all trips longer than a rideshare. The company's intentional approach increases vehicle utilization and takes cars off the road for a more sustainable future while saving customers time and money.\nThrough the Kyte mobile app on iOS, Android, or website, customers can book a car for a day, multiple days, multiple weeks, months, or however long they want. To begin, customers choose a time and location for their vehicle delivery. Then, the company dispatches a delivery driver — known as a \"Kyte Surfer\" — to deliver a clean, sanitized car at the time requested. When the vehicle is ready to be returned, a Kyte Surfer retrieves the car from the customer at the location and time they can flexibly choose.\nCurrently operational in more than 14 cities, Kyte was founded in 2019 by Nikolaus Volk, Ludwig Schoenack, and Francesco Wiedemann, is headquartered in San Francisco, CA, with offices in Munich, Germany, and satellites across the globe, and currently employs 100 people. For more information about Kyte, visit their website, and for career opportunities, please visit their career page.\nSOURCE Kyte",

    "content": "The 3D Printing Industry Awards 2022 shortlists are now available for voting. Who will win the 2022 3DPI Awards? Have your say by casting your vote now.\nIndustrial 3D printer manufacturer Desktop Metal has gained another $9 million order from an unnamed automotive customer. \nWhile Desktop Metal hasn’t identified its client, it has described them as a “major German automaker” that mass manufactures powertrain components. In practice, the customer’s new binder jet system, the second it has ordered in 12 months, will be deployed to support the production of digitally-cast automotive parts.\n“Our team is working with a significant number of global automotive OEMs to expand adoption of our differentiated AM technologies for end-use car components, and this most recent order further demonstrates our customer’s success changing the way they make products and supports Team DM’s vision for Additive Manufacturing 2.0,” explained Ric Fulop, Founder and CEO of Desktop Metal.\nDesktop Metal’s 3D printing portfolio \nMassachusetts-based Desktop Metal began by developing a range of binder jet systems, but it has drastically expanded its portfolio in recent years. At present, its in-house developed product lineup includes the Fiber, X-Series, Shop System, Studio System and Production System, a set of 3D printers the firm markets alongside a range of proprietary materials and software. \nDesktop Metal went public on the NYSE in 2021, via a SPAC merger that valued the company at $575 million, and raised a huge amount of capital to fund its future growth. Using this cash, the company has built out its offering via the acquisitions of EnvisionTEC, Aidro, Adaptive3D and one of its biggest binder jet competitors, ExOne. \nDesktop Metal has also launched new machines under its Forust brand. While the company launched its wood 3D printing service in May last year, enabling customers to order bespoke pieces of architecture binder jetted from a bio-epoxy resin composite, it has more recently introduced a turnkey Forust Shop System customers can buy, install and use in-house.  \nA newly-bolstered order backlog\nDesktop Metal’s $9 million order reflects a growing interest in its technologies within automotive, and a number other manufacturers have adopted them in recent years. In fact, during the firm’s last earnings presentation, it boasted of having high-pro clients like BMW, General Motors, Tesla, Toyota, Renault, Nissan and Ford.  \nHowever, the order also comes at a difficult time for the company. Desktop Metal laid off 12% of its staff earlier this year, citing “customers delaying purchases” amid an “uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.”\n“The challenging macroeconomic environment created great headwinds for our business,” Fulop said after Q3. “We exited the first half of the year tracking towards our financial targets, with a robust pipeline of healthy customer momentum. As the third quarter progressed, in some cases, orders we expected to close were delayed. We believe this is a result of customers pausing on CapEx spend as they become cautious about the macro landscape.”\nThat said, Desktop Metal’s latest order does add to its backlog, and takes its total revenue gained from this ‘major German automaker’ to $16.9 million. Elsewhere in its portfolio, the company has also launched the Figur G15, a machine Fulop identified on its Q3 earnings call as an “accessible, flexible and cost-effective” automotive and aerospace production tool, “even at low and medium volumes.”\nAs a result, Desktop Metal’s automotive demand should continue to grow in the quarters ahead, and there was a substantial amount of interest around the Figur G15 at the IMTS trade show. One issue that might prevent the firm capitalizing on this demand, is the competitive nature of the automotive 3D printing market. Within binder jetting, the likes of voxeljet also markets its machines as a way of creating structural car parts such as electric motor housings and dashboard modules. \nElsewhere, SLM Solutions’ Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) machines continue to gain traction among automakers. One of the company’s biggest recent customers has been Divergent Technologies, which uses NXG XII 600 systems to build the Czinger 21C 3D printed hypercar, a $2 million vehicle with a 0-62 mph speed of 1.9 seconds. \nTo stay up to date with the latest 3D printing news, don’t forget to subscribe to the 3D Printing Industry newsletter or follow us on Twitter or liking our page on Facebook.\nWhile you’re here, why not subscribe to our Youtube channel? featuring discussion, debriefs, video shorts and webinar replays. \nFeatured image shows the Desktop Metal Shop System.

    "content": "MIDVALE, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Autel, a global electric vehicle charging equipment manufacturer, announced it has launched its MaxiCharger EV charger series in Australia through a partnership with local distributor Connect Source, following the successful debut of the Autel MaxiCharger at this year’s Detroit Auto Show.\nAustralia’s EV market\nThe Australian federal government recently passed legislation to cut carbon emissions and has offered incentives to promote battery electric vehicles while phasing out conventional vehicles, which is expected to sharply increase demand for electrified mobility. New EV sales in Australia in the first three quarters of 2022 grew by 65% year-on-year and represented 3.39% of all new cars sold, according to Australia’s Electric Vehicle Council.\nEVs are forecasted by the federal government to make up 26% of new car sales by 2030 as battery costs continue to decline and as government and leading automakers including Tesla invest heavily in charging infrastructure.\nAutel MaxiCharger line-up\nAutel’s MaxiCharger line-up includes both AC chargers suitable for homes and businesses and DC fast chargers ready for volume businesses and commercial locations.\nThe MaxiCharger AC is an AC charger with an integrated touchscreen and is compatible with every EV with Type 1 or Type 2 charging port. It simplifies installation and maintenance, while intelligently designed cooling keeps temperatures under full load 10°C lower than the industry average, extending product lifespan by more than ten years.\nThe DC Wall Mount is the smallest DC charger made by Autel, running two charging ports at 47kW each. Providing 130km range from a 30min charge, with a small footprint, low installation cost, and smart advertising capabilities, this charger is the perfect DC entry charger.\nThe MaxiCharger DC Fast is Autel’s fastest charger capable of delivering between 60 kW and 240 kW of power, the latter being fast enough to add 260km in 10 minutes of charge time. Designed for charge point operators and high-volume businesses, the IP54 rated charger is ready for all demanding charging needs. Besides, a 27-inch 4k touch screen offers an advertising gateway to target customers while they’re charging, and allows for multiple payment options such as credit card, Apple Pay or Google Pay.\nAutel MaxiCharger available in Australia\nAutel’s APAC region Director Henry He stated, “Australia has excellent potential as an advanced economy to lead the Asia-Pacific region in charging infrastructure, EVs, and the push for cleaner energy sources. We are ecstatic to partner with Connect Source and bring our charging technology to the Australian public.” Autel is now offering MaxiCharger in Australia via local distributor Connect Source. Please contact Connect Source for more information.\nAbout Connect Source\nConnect Source specialize in manufacturing custom wire harnesses and electrical control system with inbuilt application, combined with their enthusiasm for deploying and supporting industry leading technology applications for fatigue & distraction detection solution, modem/telematic, driver safety products and full turnkey solution for electric vehicle chargers across various industries.",

    "title": "Tesla to deliver updated Model 3 in 2023",
    "authors": [

    ],
    "content": "Tesla is apparently working on a revised version of the Model 3 to reduce production costs and increase the appeal of the five-year-old electric sedan. However, the scope is still open – both in terms of changes to the appearance and technology, as well as those in production.\nReuters, citing four insiders, reports that one focus of the redesign for the Tesla Model 3, which is being developed under the codename ‘Highland’, is on further reducing the number of components and complexity in the interior. But the company also wants to focus on “features that Tesla buyers value”, according to the informants. The Model 3 refresh, which is to be based on the redesigned Model S and Model X, could also include some changes to the exterior and the performance of the electric drive system.\nThat sounds obvious, but a lot can be read into these statements – for example, whether the changes to the body will be in the style of the new Model S or on a similarly subtle scale. The highlight of the drive technology of the Model S and X is the layout with three electric drives – is this possible in the Model 3 in terms of installation space or is it just about a little more power? Will the Model 3 also get the yoke steering wheel of the larger models? The latter seems rather unlikely, as the Yoke steering wheel with its integrated touch fields for indicators, headlights etc. is probably more expensive to produce than the current Model 3 steering wheel with two rotary knobs. A separate speedometer display may also be seen as unlikely due to the costs.\nPossible savings in production, on the other hand, could rather be derived from the Model Y. In the case of the technically closely related SUV model, Tesla has further reduced the number of components (and thus the necessary steps in assembly) with the large die-casting machines. A structural battery pack with 4680 round cells as in the Model Y from the Giga Texas would also be theoretically conceivable. It is unclear whether Tesla already has enough 4680 cells available, as production of the Semi e-truck, which also relies on this battery format, is now also underway.\nLike the current model, the new Model 3 will be produced in Fremont, California, and in Shanghai, China. Production in China will start in the third quarter of 2023; it is not yet known when production will begin in Fremont. It is also unclear to what extent Tesla intends to reduce the costs of the Model 3 with the redesign. According to the Reuters report, this also depends on the suppliers.\nIt is well known that Tesla is working on the next big step: Elon Musk had recently stated that Tesla is planning to develop a new platform for smaller electric cars that will halve costs. Whether and how much of this can already be incorporated into the existing models is unclear.\nWhat is clear is that when it was launched, the Model 3 was virtually unrivalled in the mid-size sedan segment. There were hardly any serious alternatives for a sedan in this price and performance class. In the meantime, however, other manufacturers have followed suit, such as BYD with the upcoming 800-volt Seal model or Hyundai with the Ioniq 6, which also relies on 800-volt technology. Toyota, too, will produce a corresponding electric sedan in cooperation with BYD, at least in China, to name just a few examples.\nAnother aspect of the redesign is to make the changes visible to the outside world. Tesla has already repeatedly made changes to the Model 3 since deliveries began and introduced new features, for example in the software or the battery cells. “Having said that, consumers still tend to equate visual changes with newness,” Ed Kim, president of market research firm AutoPacific Grouo, told Reuters. “The upcoming changes that potential customers can see and feel will be very important in ensuring that EV customers still have Tesla at the top of their minds as truly excellent alternatives to Tesla are starting to flood the market.”\nWith reporting by Sebastian Schaal, Germany.\n",

    "content": "Tesla once more has to solve a safety issue via an over-the-air update. This time, it affects around 321,000 vehicles in the USA because the rear lights may sometimes not light up.\nAffected are the Model Y from the model years 2020 to 2023 and some Model 3 of MY 2023. The company said in a filing posted last weekend that their tail lights may intermittently fail to illuminate.\nThe filing to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) follows various issues and recalls Tesla had to issue in the last few weeks alone. While some 30,000 Model X had actually to return to the workshops last Friday, another potential issue with its steer assist system from November was reportedly countersteered via an over-the-air update – a practice the NHTSA is taking issue with.\nWhile Tesla would like to consider a recall for anything that requires the drivers to return their cars to the workshops physically, the NHTSA wants carmakers to a recall also in cases when a company decides to use an OTA software update to fix any such issues.\n“Any manufacturer issuing an over-the-air update that mitigates a defect that poses an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety is required to timely accompanying recall notice to NHTSA,” the authority said.\nAccording to NHTSA data, Tesla has reported 19 US recall campaigns in 2022 covering more than 3.7 million vehicles, including four callbacks in November.\n",

FINN first launched in Germany in late 2019 before expanding to the United States in 2022, where it quickly grew to the states of Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. With the addition of New York to its existing coverage areas, FINN now caters to two of the five most populous regions in the United States.\nThe company has recently announced its rapid growth to €100 Million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in less than three years after launching in Germany.

    "content": "Pittsburgh, PA, Nov.  17, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Altair International Corp. (the “Company” or “Altair”) (OTCQB Venture: ATAO) is pleased to provide the following update.  Operations of EV Lithium Solutions, Inc.  The proprietary, next-gen battery technology developed by EVLS, our Energy Storage Unit (“ESU”) has undergone significant improvement in recent months, and in a variety of aspects. We have entirely eliminated the use of Lithium in the ESU. As a result, we have battery which utilizes only electric fields and no electrochemical reactions at any stage of its function. As a direct consequence of this change, the ESU experiences none of the component degradation which takes place in Li batteries, and hence can handle an estimated 1,000,000 charge and recharge cycles with a useful life of an estimated 30 years, compared to 2-3000 for current standard Li batteries with a 10 year max lifespan.  The savings in weight compared to lithium batteries is substantial and translate to greatly increased range in EVs – the battery in a Tesla model S weighs roughly 550KG; our ESU with equal metrics in terms of power output, capacity etc. weighs roughly 400KG. The same energy to weight ratios of ESU:Li battery remain constant for ESU units of all sizes, showing a significant weight savings compared to Li batteries, in each and every one of our models.  Our unique architecture allows for configuration of the ESU to meet any variety of end-user application needs – maximum power output for shorter range, fast acceleration race vehicles of any type; slower discharge configurations for general energy storage applications (power grid backup storage) and everything in between, from forklifts, boats, construction sites, and so forth.  Interested parties can follow this link ( https://youtu.be/ytCsdykyFRI ) for a real-world demonstration of our ESU in action in the Elektra go-cart. The technical specifications of the ESU used in this Elektra demo are: 48V, 900Wh, 3KW.  EVLS is and will continue to diligently pursue avenues to commercialization of the ESU. Interested parties may inquire using the email address found below.  Stonewall Lithium and Kingsman Rare Earths Projects  Altair has recently amended its original agreement with American Lithium Minerals, Inc., to modify the required work commitments for the ’22, ’23, and ’24 calendar years. Further, we have fully satisfied our obligations to maintain the claims in good order with the US Bureau of Land Management. We continue to pursue this project and intend to work towards an initial NI 43-101 reserve estimate as soon as feasible.

    "content": "Following the start of production of the Tesla Semi in October, Tesla has now confirmed the date for the start of deliveries of the electric truck: Tesla will host a special “delivery event” on 1 December at its factory in Nevada.\nElon Musk had already mentioned this date in a tweet in October when he announced the start of production of the e-truck. According to this, deliveries to Pepsi were to start on 1 December. But after that, as is almost usual with the history of the Semi, the announcement went quiet again.\nBut in this case, Tesla seems to be keeping the date with the e-truck: For its part, the company now spread the announcement of the “Semi Delivery Event” via tweet, which is to take place on 1 December in Giga Nevada.\nWhile the Giga Nevada is a joint battery factory of Tesla and Panasonic, series production of the Semi is actually planned at the Gigafactory Texas in Austin. However, there, the truck production line there is not yet in operation. Tesla had set up a small truck production line in a new building near Gigafactory 1 in Reno – for five vehicles per week, according to Electrek. Therefore, the “delivery event” in Nevada would also make sense.\nIt is still not known how many vehicles Tesla will hand over to Pepsi on 1 December. If the information from “Electrek” is correct, around 40 Semis could have been built in the eight weeks between the announced start of production and the delivery event.\nIn fact, however, the production rate is likely to be somewhat higher: Robin Denholm, chair of the Tesla board, told the Wall Street Journal that the company was aiming to produce 100 Semis this year. This would either mean that series production would have to run for longer or that more than five vehicles would have to be built per week.\nThe real production ramp-up should then take place in 2024: Then Tesla aims to produce 50,000 units, as Elon Musk recently announced at the analysts’ conference on the latest quarterly figures. However, it has not been confirmed when exactly production is to be relocated to the Giga Texas.\n,  (production target 2022),  (production target 2024)",

Think of it as the wheel of the future meets the future of transportation. Manufactured mostly out of steel, the ASW is eco-friendly, stronger, and safer than the highly pollutive rubber tire.\nDr. Zoltan Kemeny, president and CEO of Global Air Cylinder Wheels®, explored the details and benefits of the ASW in his latest academic paper titled, \"GACW offers Innovative Range Extending Air Suspension Wheel (ASW) for Tesla and NikolaTractors and for All Trucking Trailers.\" GACW's ASW technology can offer EVs lower rolling resistance leading to extended battery range. You can read his paper here: .\nDr. Zoltan Kemeny, president and CEO of Global Air Cylinder Wheels®, explored the details and benefits of the ASW in his latest academic paper titled, \"GACW offers Innovative Range Extending Air Suspension Wheel (ASW) for Tesla and NikolaTractors and for All Trucking Trailers.\" \nYou can read his paper here: . \nManufactured mostly out of steel, the Air Suspension Wheel is eco-friendly, stronger, and safer than the highly pollutive traditional rubber tire and is up to 60% more economical over the lifetime of the wheel.\n\"Since the ASW is particularly beneficial to the tractors of the semi-trucks, Tesla and Nikola could benefit the most from its adaptation. No other wheel can save battery life and extend driving range,\" said Kemeny.\nThe U.S. has a goal of a 50% EV market share by 2030, while Europe has proposed an all-out ban on fossil fuel cars by 2035 as California and New York have done.\nGACW's ASW technology can offer EVs lower rolling resistance leading to extended battery range.\nSome companies, including Tesla, have hinted in recent years at possibly moving toward airless tires, but none has yet delivered on that promise.\nGACW is seeking an OEM partner that can develop the ASW technology specifically for cars, buses, and trucks (semis).\nA summary of the intriguing benefits of the ASW as highlighted in Kemeny's paper includes:\nSaves fuel or EV battery power (extends range) by 8-12%.\nLong-lasting airless mechanical safety wheel.\nNo flat tires. No size limits. No speed limits.\nCut, spike, riot, and sabotage resistant.\nSelf-aligning, needs no tire rotation.\nReplaces consumable tire rim with capital asset wheel.\nReplaceable polyurethane/rubber cast/pre-molded tread.\nSaves on drivetrain maintenance by 13-17%.\n100% recyclable, environment-friendly.\nReduces CO2 and NOx by 8-12% and eliminates the use of Black Carbon.\nDual size (double-wide or super-single) ASW savings of 12-16% fuel will be possible.\nThe ASW technology has a strong patent portfolio with nine granted, and with 52 patents pending.\nEncouraged by the results of its previous $3.3 million crowdfunding campaign, the company has relaunched its StartEngine campaign ---   -- to further evolve its ASW technology. The independent investment research website KingsCrowd, (), recently recommended the GACW StartEngine investment as a top deal – its highest rating possible. The current StartEngine crowdfunding campaign, which ends later this month, has raised more than $496,000 to date.\nOverall, the company has raised more than $5.5 million from investors so far and the company's valuation has increased from $27 million to $40 million since May 2022.\nThe company has teamed up with experts in the field of suspension, steel manufacturing, cylinders, and treads, and features more than 200 years of combined engineering experience.\nABOUT GLOBAL AIR CYLINDER WHEELS\nGlobal Air Cylinder Wheels®️ is an engineering company out of Phoenix, Arizona.\nMedia Contact: \nGeorge Pappas \nConservaco/The Ignite Agency \n562 857-5680 \n[email protected] \nSOURCE Global Air Cylinder Wheels",

Go to Automotive News' regularly updated database of product plans for brands that sell in the United States. Future Product Pipeline > \nToyota has previously explained the falling popularity of the Prius by pointing to the declining sales in the midsize category. The current Prius falls just below the dimensions of a midsize car with a length of 4,540 mm.\nToyota first revealed the current generation Prius in 2015. It was one of the first vehicles within the group to use the new TGNA global vehicle architecture that is also expected to underpin the new car.\nToyota touted its bigger interior space and improved fuel economy, but the car’s success was hampered by its challenging design.\nToyota is expected to increase the visual appeal of the new Prius in the same way that it ditched the outlandish looks of its original Mirai fuel-cell car, when it introduced a second-generation model.\nRelated Article\nToyota scrambles for EV reboot with eye on Tesla",

    "content": "On the road to a fully electric future, Volvo has revealed its latest EV: the Volvo EX90. The vehicle, which is a true seven-seater SUV, marks the first of several electric cars that Volvo will release on an annual basis.\nThe vehicle will arrive with a four-wheel, dual-motor powertrain, capable of producing a combined 402 horsepower and 568 pound-feet of torque in the base model. Meanwhile, the Twin Motor Performance version will reach 496 horsepower and 671 pound-feet of torque. The company estimates that the former model will accelerate to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds, while the latter will reach the same speed in 4.7 seconds.\nThe EX90 is being built on the all-new Scalable Product Architecture (SPA2), which allows for a larger battery, stronger motors, faster charging and bidirectional power. The car’s exterior, which was previewed by the Concept Recharge, features carriage-style doors, which open to a roomier interior, thanks to the absence of an internal combustion engine. Inside, there’s a 14.5-inch center screen hosting an infotainment system with Google built-in.\n“The Volvo EX90 is a statement for where we are, and where we are going,” said Jim Rowan, chief executive at Volvo. “It’s fully electric with a range of up to 300 miles on a single charge, designed to further raise our safety standards, the first Volvo car to be truly defined by its software and part of a wider ecosystem, connecting to your home and your other devices. The Volvo EX90 is the start of something new for Volvo Cars in many ways.”\nNotably, Volvo aims to sell only fully electric cars by 2030, as part of their larger ambition of becoming a climate-neutral company by 2040.\nThe 2024 Volvo EX90 is now available for pre-order in the United States on the automaker’s website, with prices beginning under $80,000 USD. Customers will be asked to configure their vehicles in Fall 2023.\nTake a look at the Volvo EX90 in the gallery above.\nIn more auto news, Tesla has recalled more than 40,000 cars over a power steering issue.",

    "content": "Alpay Uguz, center, tours the Magna factory with Jamie Butters, left, and Geeta Gupta Fisker.\nGRAZ, Austria — As I often say: Starting a car company is really hard — that's why basically only one outside of China has been successfully launched and sustained in the last half-century.\nOne of those that tried and failed was Fisker Automotive, which offered a luxury plug-in hybrid but didn't last long, largely because of supply chain woes and a lack of cash.\nHenrik Fisker's second shot at an eponymous automaker, Fisker Inc., is also coming out at a time of great economic turbulence. But it's also a very different company: electric vehicles, not PHEVs; aiming for mass-market, not luxury, appeal; defining the brand with ecological sustainability from the start.\nAnd this time, he has his wife with him in the C-suite.\nGeeta Gupta Fisker — who has a Ph.D. in biotech and organic chemistry — is a force in the young company, which is not a surprise given that she is the CFO and COO. But more important is how her talents complement her husband's. While he comes from the artistic side of the industry — he's the company's master designer as well as CEO — she has the knack for the industrial nuts and bolts of getting all the nuts and bolts (and batteries) in the right place at a reasonable price.\nWhile he's spent his career in the auto industry, best known as a designer for Aston Martin and BMW, she is new to it. Well, not exactly new: Her father, she told me, had an aftermarket auto parts business in India, so she kind of grew up around it. She's spent most of her work years in investing with Lloyds Banking Group and later with family offices — companies that build private wealth for efficient transfer across generations. That's where she honed the deal-making skills that are so often called upon now with bankers, battery makers, other suppliers.\nWhile purchasing is one of her core areas, Geeta Fisker told me that she's careful not to micromanage negotiations because she doesn't want to undermine the good team she's put together.\nTiming, pricing\nSome big, strategic decisions, however, must be made at the top of the house, like where to make vehicles and who supplies the batteries. The big ones that stand out to me right now are around timing and pricing.\nThe company is set to officially begin production of the Ocean on Thursday, Nov. 17, as has been planned for more than a year. It should win the company some credibility in contrast to Elon Musk's track record at Tesla, where he repeatedly announced plans that didn't get done when he said they would — or sometimes at all — though it mostly has worked out fabulously for him.\nStill, this start of production doesn't mean that the first of the Ocean's 60,000-plus reservation holders are going to get their cars in 2022: Approval for global sales is still weeks or months away.\nI found it curious that the car will go into production with many key features to come later. Cruise control, for instance, is a pretty basic offering that won't be ready at launch. Other, higher-end capabilities also won't be immediately released, such as its Power Bank package for vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-vehicle charging, which should roll out over 2023 and '24, according to materials provided to journalists here.\nOne factor, of course, is the need for such systems to work quite perfectly so as to not endanger drivers, passengers or neighbors. More strategically, Henrik Fisker explained, is prioritizing the exceptional features that would compel a purchase. (He isn't a big fan of cruise control himself.)\nThe consumers of the world, he argues, are not clamoring for another car that does what all cars do. His aim is to provide features that can't be found anywhere else: best-in-class range, the rotating 17.1-inch screen, the solar roof that helps charge the battery — as well as the doggie windows in back and taco trays for front-seat passengers.\nAnother tough decision: pricing.\nIt's no secret that inflation is bedeviling not only the U.S. economy but the entire world — and perhaps nowhere more than in Europe, where war has made energy scarce and dollar-euro parity has made imports more expensive.\nAnd the EV boom has sent the prices of critical minerals for batteries soaring — with years to come before new mining, processing and manufacturing can be brought up to speed.\nTesla raised prices. Ford raised EV prices. Rivian raised prices — then quickly reversed course.\nHenrik Fisker said he promised customers to hold the line on prices at least through the first 40,000 vehicles produced — a threshold the company expects to surpass in the second half of next year. Geeta Fisker stressed that the company has good cost controls and didn't plan for any models to be loss leaders — underpriced products that lose money in order to attract customer interest.\nIncluding money raised in the third quarter that essentially covered the cash used in operations and investing, the leaders are confident they can make it through the first launch, find their place in the market, and earn enough to get through the introduction of its planned second model, the Pear, and beyond.\nRelated Article\nHere's our 2022 list of the top U.S. dealership groups\nQuality focus\nWill Fisker Inc. make it? Working with Magna as a manufacturing partner gives me some confidence that doesn't necessarily extend to the Pear, which Foxconn is supposed to start making in Lordstown in 2024.\nBut the addition of Alpay Uguz, who had been at BMW's South Carolina plant and said he has managed 18 launches, mitigates that somewhat.\nAs he showed us around Magna's legendary Graz, Austria, plant, he kept emphasizing the extraordinary emphasis on quality processes and control systems. It's also nice to know that the workers at the factory also produce the BMW 5 Series and Z4 as well as the Toyota Supra. (The Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon comes down a separate line.)\n\"What's important is not to have the output,\" he said, \"it's to have the right quality output.\"\nWhen Henrik Fisker was talking about the features planned to be added over time — including some that are being developed but haven't been announced yet — he mused: \"I think you're going to end up seeing that a car will never really seem finished — that it will continue to evolve.\"\n(Until it reaches the end of its usefulness and is dismantled for reuse and recycling.)\nWhich I guess one can also say about the companies that make and sell cars, too.",

    "title": "How the Victorians Took Us to the Moon by Iwan Rhys Morus review –  science’s showmen",
    "authors": [
      "Katy Guest"
    ],
    "content": "As he unveiled Tesla’s new humanoid robot, Optimus, this September, Elon Musk spoke with characteristic flamboyance about the device’s potential. “This means a future of abundance,” he declared. “A future where there is no poverty … It really is a fundamental transformation of civilisation as we know it.” Perhaps deliberately, he was echoing the tone of his company’s namesake, Nikola Tesla, who in the 1890s was making similarly bold claims about his own work-in-progress. With his new system of wireless telegraphy, Tesla insisted, battleships would be controlled remotely, meaning that pretty soon “war would be abolished” and there would be a “revolution in the politics of the whole world”.\nHow the Victorians Took Us to the Moon argues that this triumphalist view of the future, so much the norm among Tesla’s contemporaries, led directly to the advances that enabled the moon landings, the technological present we now inhabit and the way we still think about the future today. It rattles thrillingly through such developments as the Transatlantic telegraph cable, the steam locomotive and electric power and recalls the excitable predictions of the fiction of the time: “In the year 2000 imagined in John Jacob Astor’s A Journey in Other Worlds, electricity was ubiquitous … Everyone had a windmill on their roof.”\nThe book describes the kind of men who did science, how they did it and who they did it for. And they were largely men, as Morus is at pains to point out. As the biographer of Tesla and Michael Faraday, his previous work seems to support a “Great Man” theory of history, and certainly references to Joule, Hertz, Siemens and Morse pepper the text. Mathematician Ada Lovelace’s name appears (though only as frequently as that of her father, the poet Lord Byron); Eleanor Sidgwick, who worked on electrical resistance, is mentioned. But the repeated assertion that “the future was … made by singular men” comes to seem like an excuse, when you think of the women who might have been included. What about Josephine Cochrane, who patented the dishwasher in 1886; the domestic and shipping patents awarded to Sarah Guppy; the bestselling popular science books of Mary Somerville; the discoveries of the palaeontologist Mary Anning?\nThose who do get Morus’s attention often made their names through fabulous showmanship. They displayed their creations at public palaces of discovery in London, while “the curious flocked to see a new world being made” at factories and engineering works around the country. He describes a grand banquet of distinguished guests in Marc and Isambard Brunel’s half-finished tunnel under the Thames in 1827, “serenaded by the Coldstream Guards Band”. But work on the tunnel “was punctuated by strikes as the men who toiled beneath the river fought for a [fair] wage”.\nFor these great men relied heavily on talented teams of makers and engineers. Here, the author does acknowledge unsung heroes. Joseph Clement was the precision toolmaker who made components for Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine, an early computer; his departure in 1833, after disputes over the ownership of the tools, marked the end of the project. The glaziers building the Crystal Palace to house the Great Exhibition went on strike in 1850, demanding a safer pace of work. The strike was broken and its leader arrested.\nWe learn how upper-class gatekeepers of science and knowledge did not welcome contributions from lesser sorts. Before he was known as the “father of railways”, George Stephenson invented a safety lamp for miners. Scientist John Ayrton Paris wrote of his achievement: “It will hereafter be scarcely believed that an invention so eminently philosophic, and which could never have been derived but from the sterling treasury of science, should have been claimed on behalf of an engine-wright of Killingworth … not even professing a knowledge of the elements of chemistry.” How many inventions were lost altogether because their creators had no status or power? An interesting subject for another book, perhaps.Morus does not shy away from highlighting the intertwined roles of innovation and colonialism in Victorian Britain. In the 1800s, scientists called for discipline, measurement and standardisation, while “deciding what (and who) to count was a political matter that went to the heart of imperial government”. John Beddoe’s The Races of Great Britain (1862), which defined a hierarchy based on physical characteristics, was just one way of “rational” men “displaying the discipline they thought made the Empire great, and imposing discipline on its peoples”.\nIt’s important to understand how Victorians invented the future, Morus writes, because “we’ve also inherited some of [their] unthinking assumptions. We still imagine that our future will be made by men like these – charismatic innovators willing to take risks but possessed of the self-discipline and drive needed to get the job done.” This book implies that the spirit of Victorian invention was made of arrogance, imperialism and masculinity. Some readers may agree that our future will be made by the same brand of charismatic man. Others might hope that collaboration, open-mindedness and inclusivity will play more of a role in our 21st-century technological adventure.\nSign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of our brand new magazine, Saturday.

The blue check-mark feature was previously only given to celebrities and other official figures.\nBIDEN ASKED WHETHER ELON MUSK IS 'THREAT' TO NATIONAL SECURITY, SAYS RELATIONSHIPS 'WORTH BEING LOOKED AT'\n\"To combat impersonation, we’ve added an \"Official\" label to some accounts,\" the Twitter Support account tweeted Friday morning.\nThe \"official\" label appears to distinguish those who were authenticated by Twitter versus those who pay for the Twitter Blue subscription. Famous Twitter users with blue check-marks are expected to lose them as Twitter Blue continues its rollout.\nTWITTER ADDS ‘OFFICIAL’ LABELS TO SELECT VERIFIED ACCOUNTS — THEN REVERSES COURSE\nThe \"official\" label was introduced two days earlier on Wednesday, but was prompted removed from the platform.

    "content": "On November 8, 2022, BYD disclosed its plan to launch a new Premium EV. The Shenzhen-based automobile company plans to unveil the electric vehicle by the first quarter of 2023. According to BYD, the new premium brand will cost above CNY 1 million (ABOUT USD 138,000), adding that the price will remain the same. This price tag will make the premium EV series the company’s most expensive model. Currently, the most expensive model of BYD is Denza D9, a limited edition car co-ventured with Mercedes Benz. Denza D9 costs over USD 96,000.\nIn April 2022, BYD announced a change in its company’s policy. BYD noted that the company would seize the production of gasoline cars. However, the company will continue to manufacture gasoline engines for hybrid vehicles. This strategic change will make the company focus exclusively on plug-in hybrid and pure electric vehicles. Despite producing hybrid vehicles, many Chinese are more interested in electric vehicles. In recent times, the government’s incentives for hybrid cars have been rare to come by. The Chinese government describes electric cars as the 'new energy vehicles.' China’s EV sales jumped by approximately 92% YoY to reach 1.24 million units in Q2 2022. Meanwhile, only 0.64 million units were sold in the second quarter of 2021. In 2021, BYD had the second-highest EV sales after SAIC. BYD managed to sell over 320,000 EVs in that year.\nSince January 2022, BYD has continued to record increased sales of vehicles, of which a larger percentage were EVs. Sales report shows that over 97% of the vehicles sold by BYD were EVs. The company sold 46,386 pure EVs and 46,540 hybrid vehicles in January. Recently, BYD sold over 200000 cars monthly, increasing sales to over 187% year-on-year. In Q3 2022, the Chinese company produced 534,164 units dethroning the popular American pure EV maker, Tesla Inc., in deliveries. In October 2022, retail sales of new-energy vehicles in China rose by 75%, with BYD leading the sales, followed by Tesla. Most sales came from BYD’s top three models: BYD Song, BYD Han, and BYD Qin.\nBYD is on its tenth consecutive sales record for the new EV series. According to BYD’s recent filings, the company has sold over 1.4 million units from January to October. Currently, it has the highest electric vehicle sales in the world’s auto market. The position of BYD in the automobile market is set to take another positive turn with the upcoming premium EV release. Invariably, the BYD premium EV series launch will increase its competitiveness in the market. Before this announcement, the Chinese market has yet to embrace high-end vehicles. Only a few companies, like NIO, Lucid, Porsche, and Tesla, have high-end EV models.",

(CSE: GEMS) (OTC: GEMSF) (FSE: B2I) (the \"\nCompany\" or \"\nInfinity Stone\"), is pleased to provide a general corporate update on the Company's recent activities, initiatives and upcoming catalysts for growth. Infinity Stone has been active with exploration on its four core battery metal projects with extensive prospecting and preliminary work ahead of planned and ongoing drilling programs. The Company's current drill program on the Rockstone Graphite Project has recovered its first core sample from the RS-22-01 drill hole, a twinned hole of the GC-12-01 discovery hole, which intercepted 25% Cg over 24 metres.\n\"Battery metals, and lithium specifically, have been one of the only performing asset classes over the past year, in a volatile economic climate driven by inflation and rising interest rates. We have stayed true to our goal of providing a diversified investment platform for battery metals and believe we are still in the early stages of a market that is about to take off\", said Zayn Kalyan, CEO of Infinity Stone Ventures. \"It seems that on a nearly daily basis there are announcements of investment and development in the lithium-ion battery supply chain in North America. From new battery metal processing infrastructure to EV manufacturing plants, it is quickly becoming evident that Quebec and Ontario are at the epicentre of a major shift of investment from government and the private sector. With major manufacturers such as Tesla, Mercedes and VW making direct investment in battery metal mining and exploration companies, it is an unprecedented time to be in this industry, and Infinity Stone is ideally positioned,\" furthered Mr. Kalyan.\nShort-Term Catalysts for Growth\nSamples from Hellcat/Camaro, Galaxy and Zen-Whoberi currently in-lab awaiting assay\nRockstone metallurgical work with SGS Labs, refining discovery core to battery grade, currently ongoing, 6 weeks till estimated program completion\nRockstone Fall Drill Program underway to twin discovery GC-12-01 drill hole\nExtensive geophysics program planned for Camaro-Hellcat, Galaxy and Zen-Whoberi over next 30 days\nFurther upcoming drill programs in Q1 2023\nInvestor Presentation\nSchedule Call with Management\nRecent News\nNovember 7, 2022 - Infinity Stone Engages with LGC Standards for Pegmatite Bulk Sample Processing\nNovember 2, 2022 - Infinity Stone Further Expands Galaxy Lithium Project with New Zone\nOctober 27, 2022 - Infinity Stone Provides Exploration Update on Camaro – Hellcat Lithium Project\nOctober 18, 2022 - Infinity Stone to Commence Drilling on Rockstone Graphite Project\nOctober 13, 2022 - Infinity Stone Expands with New Claim Block Adjacent to Hellcat Lithium Project in James Bay Lithium District\nOctober 12, 2022 - Infinity Stone Expands Galaxy Lithium Project in Quebec\nOctober 6, 2022 - Infinity Stone Announces Change of Symbol on OTCQB to GEMSF\nOctober 5, 2022 - Infinity Stone Closes $2.1M Private Placement and Intention to Dual \nList of ASX\nSeptember 22, 2022 - Infinity Stone to Commence Trading On OTCQB Under Symbol \n'TLOOF'\nSeptember 20, 2022 - Infinity Stone Commences Exploration Program at Camaro Lithium Project in James Bay, Quebec, Contracts Axiom Exploration Group\nSeptember 16, 2022 - Infinity Stone Discovers 15.5% Copper from New Zone at Zen-Whoberi Project\nSeptember 12, 2022 - Infinity Stone Engages SGS Labs To Upgrade Rockstone Graphite To EV Battery-Grade\nMedia Articles and Features\nNovember 4, 2022 - Stockhead: Infinity Stone supplies 150kg pegmatite sample from Galaxy to be processed into CRM\nNovember 3, 2022 - Proactive: Infinity Stone Ventures expands claims at Galaxy project in Quebec showing a \"sea of pegmatites\"\nNovember 3, 2022 - Resource Stock Digest: Infinity Stone Ventures (CSE: GEMS)(OTC: GEMSF) CEO Zayn Kalyan on De-Risking & Advancing A Critical Metals Portfolio to Help Meet Surging Demand\nNovember 2, 2022 - AGORACOM: Infinity Stone $GEMS Is Collecting Minerals For EV Batteries That Iron Man & The Avengers Would Envy\nNovember 2, 2022 - Stockhouse Publishing: Infinity Stone Further Expands Galaxy Lithium Project with New Zone\nOctober 21, 2022 - Independent Tribune: Zayn Kalyan: Lithium shortage will require more mining to speed the production of electric vehicles\nOctober 20, 2022 - Virtual Investor Conferences: Infinity Stone Ventures Corp.

    "content": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Nov. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Dawn Project has yesterday launched a full page advertisement in The New York Times highlighting the dangers of Tesla Full Self-Driving after safety tests reveal that it will repeatedly run down child-sized mannequins in its path.\nThe Dawn Project's advertisement was published in The New York Times yesterday, and can be seen here.\nThe ad reports that safety tests conducted by The Dawn Project reveal that Elon Musk's Full Self-Driving software would repeatedly run down child-sized mannequins in its path.\nThe safety tests were conducted in Goleta, California in October 2022 using the latest version of Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software available at the time of testing, FSD Beta 10.69.2.2.\nThe tests were conducted in dry conditions in both daylight and dusk conditions on a public road in Goleta, CA, where the posted speed limit was 55mph. On each run, the driver shows the internal camera the FSD's display to show the viewer that FSD is clearly engaged, together with which settings the Tesla is operating. A full video of The Dawn Project's safety tests can be found here.\nA mannequin was placed on the side of the road and pulled across the road to simulate a child crossing the road, in order to make the scenario as realistic as possible. The mannequins used were 29 inches and four feet in height respectively.\nThe Dawn Project conducted the safety tests using moving mannequins, as well as testing at a variety of speeds between 15mph and 55mph to determine the ability of Tesla's Full Self-Driving to avoid a child-sized mannequin in the road. \nDuring the fifteen runs, the Tesla collided with the mannequin crossing its path on each occasion. Even at speeds as low as 15mph, Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta 10.69.2.2 collided with the 29-inch mannequin. At 20mph, the Tesla still struck the 4-foot mannequin.\nThe Dawn Project is demanding that NHTSA issue an emergency recall of Tesla's Full Self-Driving software to ensure that road users and pedestrians are protected from the dangers posed by the mass deployment of this technology on public roads.\nNotes to Editors:\nDan O'Dowd is an entrepreneur and CEO with over 40 years' experience in designing and writing secure, safety-critical software. Dan has built operating systems for the U.S. military's fighter jets and some of the world's most trusted organizations such as NASA, Boeing, and Airbus. His company, Green Hills Software, also helps automotive companies achieve safety and security, including that necessary for production-level automated driving systems, offering operating systems and development tools designed to address software security threats.\nNow, Dan's safety advocacy and research organization, The Dawn Project, is campaigning to ban dangerous and defective technology from public roads and protect our communities.\nIn 2021 Dan O'Dowd founded The Dawn Project, which campaigns to ensure all software in safety-critical infrastructure is secure and to make computers safe for humanity. The first danger The Dawn Project is tackling is Elon Musk's reckless deployment of unsafe Full Self-Driving cars on our roads.\nContact: [email protected]\nSOURCE The Dawn Project",

    "content": "TOKYO - Japan's Honda Motor Co unveiled the second model of its new China-only electric vehicle (EV) lineup on Saturday, targeting the fast-growing, battery-driven car segment in the world's largest auto market.\nThe Japanese automaker said last year it planned to roll out EV models under a new brand called \"e:N Series\" over the next five years with partners GAC and Dongfeng Motor . It began selling the first model in China in April.\n\"Honda is transforming itself into an electric brand in China with a series of unique and diverse electric mobility products that only Honda can offer,\" said Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe in a statement.\nA key challenge facing Honda and its major Japanese peers, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co, is catching up to rivals such as Tesla Inc who have forged ahead in the EV sector.\nHonda laid out a target to roll out 30 EV models globally and produce some 2 million EVs a year by 2030 earlier this year.\nLast year, it said it would introduce only electrified vehicle models in China after 2030, including battery electric, hydrogen fuel-cell or petrol-electric automobiles.\nIts two joint ventures, GAC-Honda and Dongfeng-Honda, plan to build new EV-only assembly plants that are expected to begin production in 2024.\n(Reporting by Satoshi Sugiyama; Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa)",

    "content": "Tesla has released a firmware update to fix nearly 40,000 vehicles, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. Photo by Terry Schmitt/UPI | License Photo\nNov. 8 (UPI) -- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that Tesla released a firmware update to address the voluntary recall of 40,000 vehicles that had issues with their electronic power assist steering system. The issue with the 2017-2021 Model S and Model X vehicles could have led to reduced or lost power steering assist due to potholes or bumps, the NHTSA said. Advertisement\nThe agency said that Tesla began to release its update on Oct. 11, which included new calibration values for the electronic power assist steering system. After receiving alerts relating to the calibration values, Tesla decided to recall the vehicles on Oct. 25.\nIn September, Tesla also had to recall almost 1.1 million vehicles because of a possible safety issue with its automatic windows.\nThat recall included some 2017-2022 Model 3, 2020-2021 Model Y, and 2021-2022 Model S and Model X vehicles.",

    "content": "DUBLIN, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The \"New Energy Vehicle Thermal Management System Market Research Report,2022\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\nThe rapid development of Chinese new energy vehicles has brought more opportunities for parts and components. Chinese enterprises, such as Sanhua Intelligent Controls, Zhejiang Yinlun Machinery, Aotecar, Tuopu Group, etc., have been actively deploying new energy thermal management in recent years. They have obtained orders from emerging automakers, domestic and foreign OEMs and other new energy vehicle companies for thermal management products, and made a breakthrough in the core technology of new energy vehicles.\nMarket and Technology Trends of System Components\n`New Energy Vehicle Thermal Management System Market Research Report, 2022` released by the publisher summarizes and analyzes top 12 providers of new energy vehicle thermal management system integration solutions, top 10 suppliers of heat pump air conditioners, top 10 suppliers of electric compressors, top 10 suppliers of electronic water pumps, top 7 suppliers of battery thermal management systems, top 6 suppliers of thermal management system piping, top 5 suppliers of heat exchangers, and top 4 suppliers of electronic expansion valves.\nDevelopment Trend 1: Heat Pump Air Conditioning System\nThe heat pump system represents a clear development direction for thermal management of new energy vehicles. More and more models adopt heat pumps which can realize comprehensive energy utilization for new energy vehicles. In the future, the heat pump system will develop towards integration and modularization.\nDevelopment Trend 2: Refrigerant Technology Routes\nWith the steady advancement of environmental protection policies, the replacement of R-134a has become inevitable, but automakers have different opinions on choosing R-1234yf or CO(2) as refrigerant.\nDuPont and Honeywell developed R-1234yf jointly and applied for a production process patent for it, which means the use of the technology requires a patent fee. American automakers like GM, Ford, etc., as well as French automakers like PSA, etc. adopt R-1234yf.\nIn addition to Eco-friendly and heat pump performance, CO(2) is relatively safer because it is not flammable while R-1234yf is moderately flammable. German automakers like Daimler, Volkswagen, BMW, etc. prefer CO(2).\nEvolution of Heat Pump Air Conditioning Refrigerant Technology\nDevelopment Trend 3: Electric Compressors\nWith the development of new energy vehicles, almost all automotive air-conditioning compressor companies are aggressively transferring to electric compressors. Since electric compressors have a short history as emerging components, most players are standing on the same starting line. With increasing market demand, electric compressor takes relatively tight capacity and is in short supply.\nEmerging enterprises: As the sales volume of new energy vehicles escalates, thermal management industry has seen a boarder market space, and a large number of enterprises including conventional white goods enterprises (such as Hisense, Gree, Midea, etc.) and new energy vehicle companies have flocked to electric compressor industry. However, it is not easy for conventional white goods companies to dabble in the field of automotive air conditioning. Nowadays, there is no outstanding Chinese air conditioner brand that excels in automotive air conditioners and air conditioner compressors.\nNew technology routes: The current novel technology routes for electric compressors include:\nR744 (CO2) compressors (R744 ultra-low-temperature heat pump compressors of Shanghai EVERLAND AMPEREX)\nAir-enhancing enthalpy compressors (air-enhancing enthalpy compressors of Aotecar and Shanghai EVERLAND AMPEREX)\n800V electric compressors (Brose's 800V/55cc electronic air conditioner compressors, MAHLE's 800V 57cc electric compressors), etc.\nTechnical Architecture and Trends of OEM Thermal Management Systems\nThe automotive thermal management system controls heat of entire vehicle to ensure that the occupants, batteries, motors, and other components are all within a comfortable temperature environment. New energy vehicles have higher requirements for thermal management, so that the cost herein is about three times that of fuel vehicles. New energy vehicles not only add battery thermal management systems, but also require product replacement and upgrades. Moreover, new energy vehicle components are more sensitive to temperature, so there are higher requirements for components and more detailed requirements for the coordination of all components.\nUnder such circumstances, new energy vehicle OEMs have launched their own unique thermal management system solutions, dominating the development of thermal management solutions and featuring significant customization.\nFor example, BYD's latest e-platform 3.0 enables heat pump integration. Under the architecture of e-platform 3.0, the integrated thermal management system no longer simply integrates cockpit air conditioning system and blade battery thermal management system.\nIn terms of design concept, the thermal management system is similar to Tesla's integrated valve island solution, which integrates refrigerant circuit on a large scale. The valve island structure integrates most control components of refrigerant circuit, and divides them into electric compressors, front-end modules, thermal management integrated modules, in-vehicle condensers and evaporators, which are controlled by software through electric drive system.\nUnder e-platform 3.0 architecture, the integrated thermal management system based on BC series heat pump air conditioning reduces energy loss, conducts the interaction of cooling and heat around cockpit and power battery, makes BYD OS control domains, sends cooling directly to blade battery and cockpit, and allows heat to be transferred between electric drive system, cockpit and blade battery.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1 Introduction and Policy of New Energy Vehicle Thermal Management System\n1.1 Introduction of New Energy Vehicle Thermal Management System\n1.1.1 Definition\n1.1.2 Traditional/New Energy Vehicle Thermal Management System Structure\n1.1.3 Traditional/New Energy Vehicle Thermal Management System -

    "content": "French automaker Renault announced a major reorganization on Tuesday, splitting its operations into a new electric vehicle unit and a separate internal combustion engine division with China's Geely.\nThe flagship division of its revamp, electric vehicle and software entity Ampere, was being prepared for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Euronext Paris in the latter half of next year at the earliest, it said in a statement.\nThe new entity will employ around 10,000 staff in France and produce the R5 and 4L electric vehicles in the north of the country, the carmaker said as it outlined the revamp for investors.\nThe electric vehicle market is expected to grow rapidly in response to consumers' worries about climate change, putting pressure on manufacturers to develop less polluting products.\nThe European Union last month agreed to phase out new carbon dioxide-emitting vehicles by 2035, a move set to turbo-charge the production of electric prototypes on the continent.\nRenault said it plans to invite investment in Ampere but would remain the majority shareholder with \"the support of potential strategic cornerstone investors.\"\nRenault also intends to combine its technological, manufacturing and research and development activities for its hybrid and internal-combustion vehicles with Chinese automaker Geely in a new entity, \"Horse.\"\nThe groups will share the division to design, develop, produce and sell components and systems for hybrid and internal-combustion vehicles, employing 19,000 people at 17 powertrain factories and three research and development hubs across Europe, China and South America.\nIn 2020, Renault suffered a historic loss and its recovery was destabilized by its withdrawal from Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\nThe value of traditional car manufacturers pales in comparison to new players on the market specializing in electric vehicles such as Elon Musk's Tesla or Chinese firm BYD.\nRenault still needs a large investment to accelerate its electric transformation according to plans it presented in 2020.\nU.S. giant Ford has taken similar steps, announcing the creation of the \"Ford Model E\" earlier this year.\nThe announcement comes as the sales of traditional internal-combustion vehicles fall.\nIn the first nine months of 2022, hybrid and electric vehicles represented 38% of the brand's registrations in Europe, a year-on-year increase of 12%.\nThe separation of Renault's activities has concerned trade unions after several waves of job cuts.\nInvestors on Monday expressed their interest in Renault's transformation, with the group's stock value climbing 3.77% on the Paris stock market.",

The fully-electric truck has a claimed range of more than 805km but hasn’t reached production due to Covid-19 and Musk’s other ongoing projects.\nAlthough the production date has been pushed back numerous times, the Cybertruck is expected to join the Model 3, Model S and Model X in 2023. It is unclear what specifications will be included in the Cybertruck, but the CEO has previously said the company is working on a new-generation air suspension with longer travel for off- road use.\nMusk is known for making bold statements, but not always following through. However, he tweeted that the Cybertruck’s new suspension should “kick butt in Baja”. It was presumed that he was referring to Baja California, home of the famous Baja 500 and 1000 desert races, and regarded as one of the world’s toughest off-road races. As the company puts it, this new Tesla is “designed to have the utility of a truck and the performance of a sports car.” Let’s wait and see.\nRelated: Tesla Model S 100D: Meet the world’s longest-range electric vehicle yet",

    "content": "FAW and Toyota have officially unveiled their highly anticipated first electric sedan in China. Dubbed bZ3, the electric vehicle (EV) competes with Tesla Model 3, Changan Shenlan SL03, Volkswagen e-Golf, and other similar electric cars.\nToyota has developed its new EV in partnership with China’s FAW Group and BYD. The company’s first electric SUV, bZ4X, was developed in collaboration with GAC Motor.\nALSO READ Pakistan Railways Partially Privatizes Over a Dozen Passenger Trains\nSo far, Toyota plans to launch bZ3 in China only, with a starting price of around $28,000 (Rs. 6.1 million).\nDetails\nToyota bZ3 borrows BYD’s Blade LFP battery pack, though the battery size is still under wraps. The automaker claims that the car will have a range of over 600 kilometers on a full charge.\nbZ3 will have two single-electric motor options — one in the lower trim level produces 183 horsepower (hp) and the other in the higher trim level produces 244 hp. In both variants, the electric motors power the rear wheels.\nThe EV will include all Toyota Safety Sense features such as lane-keeping assistance, collision warning, and avoidance, adaptive cruise control, autonomous braking, automatic high beam, road sign assist, etc.\nThe compact EV currently faces huge competition in China and will likely struggle in grabbing a sizeable market share among affordable EVs.\nRestrategizing EV Development\nLast year, Toyota announced its electric vehicle (EV) adoption strategy. However, new reports indicate that the company may be going back to the drawing board.\nAccording to Reuters, Toyota has formed an internal group to devise strategies for improving its current e-TNGA flexible EV platform or developing a new EV architecture. The e-TNGA platform is already used in the bZ4X crossover SUV and will also underpin the upcoming Lexus RZ 450e in 2023.\nALSO READ Expect Road Blocks as PTI Announces Protests in Islamabad and Rawalpindi\nSources claim that Toyota’s EV development process is too slow and expensive in comparison to other manufacturers. To address the issue, Toyota is planning to rework its EV development strategy.",

    "content": "KULR Technology (NYSE: KULR) stock is a bright spot in an otherwise weak market. Shares continue to trade higher after KULR provided a series of updates expected to be accretive to near and long-term growth. In October, those updates sent KULR shares higher by over 98% on an intra-month basis. More importantly, they are holding the lion's share of that increase despite another bear attack on small-cap stocks. Perhaps the best news from a technical perspective is that KULR shares appear poised to continue their bullish trend and hold higher levels not seen since April.\nThat presumption is warranted. Updates indicate that KULR remains committed to increasing shareholder value sooner than later and has earned a consistent flow of new and add-on contracts adding to record-setting revenue reports during the past few quarters. Most recently, the company announced that it is hosting a meeting of the Society of Aerospace Engineers (\"SAE\") G-27 Lithium Battery Packaging Performance Committee in San Diego during the week of November 8th. There, KULR will showcase its suite of battery safety Solutions, including SafeCase, a reusable, safe, and high-energy battery transportation and storage solution already meeting aviation regulations regarding the transport of lithium-ion batteries.\nWhile that conference should attract industry attention, KULR should benefit further from other news, including its development work with the Andretti Racing team, the inclusion of the No. 98 KULR Technology Honda for the 2023 Indianapolis 500®, and several follow-on contracts from global business giants that continue to validate its specialized products with its growing arsenal. Those announcements helped start the rally.\nBut also in play is KULR's earnings conference call on November 9th. The speculation is that earnings won't disappoint, and, instead, add to the prior record-setting performances. Forward-looking commentary will also help shape the narrative that 2023 is set up to be a breakout year for the company.\nA Streak Of Product And Technology Validation\nIf the outlook stays positive, which is expected based on recent updates, KULR's run should continue despite broader market pressures. Keep in mind that KULR is already better positioned for growth today than at any time in its history. So, added revenue-generating optimism driven by new products, developing technologies, and extension into new market opportunities that present billion-dollar revenue-generating shots on goals would likely add fuel to the bullish investor sentiment.\nIn the spotlight is KULR SafeCase technology, a reusable, safe, high-energy battery transportation and storage solution. KULR announced receiving a production prototype order last month from a client who KULR described as a \"top-tier power tool manufacturer\" that is a leading manufacturer in sustainability and safety within the industrial tool and household hardware sectors. Also important to KULR's revenue-generating interests, they are said to be active in lithium-ion battery safety, transportation, education, and recycling initiatives.\nThat deal, like its one made in the metaverse space with another unnamed \"global business leader,\" is the type that could lead to substantial add-on contracts. That's because clients aren't coming to KULR out of convenience; they are coming out of necessity, with KULR battery-safety technology continuing to prove it's a best-in-class, best-in-industry solution to protect company assets and programs. Moreover, because KULR technology could provide client companies means to gain competitive advantages from its proprietary technology, it puts potentially millions of products in play.\nRemember, anything using lithium-ion battery power needs safety integration, and that means everything from toys to power tools to space stations need what KULR sells.\nAdded Value From Contracts And Partnerships\nOf course, investors want to see higher revenues. And KULR is creating new pathways to generate more of it. As noted, its SafeCase technology solution is a current focus. And is attracting multi-level interest from its unique ability to allow KULR and its partners to leverage special permits from the U.S. Department of Transportation for the safe shipping of lithium-ion batteries up to 2.5 kilowatt-hours. Incidentally, with SafeCase being the only known product providing standard and customized case sizes while incorporating a reusable, sustainable, and cost-effective design, the competitive landscape could be thin.\nMore than a better design can keep it that way. From a functional standpoint, SafeCase provides cost-effective warehouse storage for fire safety and transportation. It also meets specific needs in the commercial lithium-ion battery markets, including providing safety technologies for products using powerful, densely packed lithium-ion power. That includes protecting everything from consumer products to large-scale industrial applications and everything in between. More than putting multiple market sales opportunities in play, it diversifies KULR's near-term opportunities and strengthens its long-term ones.\nKeep this in mind, too, when appraising KULR's potential. Its patented technology makes them the only known company in the world with a product approved by the DoT for storage and transport of lithium-ion batteries managing up to a capacity of 2.5 kWh for recycled, prototype, and damaged, defective, and recalled batteries. That distinction and advantage should not be under-appreciated or undervalued because it immediately puts multiple sector opportunities in KULR's business crosshairs.\nAdd-On Contracts From Global Business Leaders\nBut remember, the DoT opportunity is a small part of that technology reach. Ongoing work with the Andretti team is also opening revenue-generating opportunities in the EV sector, with its SafeCase and energy management platform a seamless fit to provide battery safety applications on the consumer side of those markets. Those needing battery-safety solutions include the prominent sector giants like Tesla (NYSE: TSLA), smaller players like Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), and every other company needing lithium-ion technology to power their products. Here's the exciting part of that opportunity; these industries may have no choice but to integrate robust battery-safety technologies.\nWith tens of millions of batteries needed and used annually to power not only the EV sector, but also many others, the focus has intensified on how to help mitigate potentially catastrophic battery-related events. In fact, speculation is growing that mandates could be enacted to protect users in both consumer and industrial markets. In the case of battery safety, especially with the massive power encapsulated in small housings, those protections are warranted. And with lithium-ion batteries the critical ingredient to power phones, automobiles, tools, and even trips to space, there's plenty supporting safety advocates' case for having safety measures embedded as part of product development.\nIf that's the end result, the excellent news for KULR is that they are probably the best-positioned company to capitalize on the opportunity. And that would deliver to them a battery safety and global energy storage solutions market expected to reach $554 billion by 2035. But it's not likely the dollar opportunity stops there. Worldwide interest in green-energy solutions could make an already hot market opportunity scorching. And that could further incentivize the KULR bulls to bid shares higher.\nMultiple Shots On Revenue-Generating Goals\nStill, everything in play aren't only forward-looking propositions. KULR's revenue-generating mission is already generating results, with its suite of innovative technology providing essential thermal management and safety system technologies to just about any sector in business using lithium-ion power. That includes government agencies like NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense, two agencies already on KULR's client list. But that list also includes global business giants, including Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), speculation about Meta (NASDAQ: META) being one for its Metaverse interests, and Leidos (NASDAQ: LDOS), to name a few.\nThey are choosing to work with KULR for good reasons. Foremost is KULR's ability to serve client-specific needs through its highly configurable thermal interface materials. Especially its lightweight heat exchangers and monitoring systems that help to ensure that lithium-ion batteries and the machinery they power can operate efficiently while minimizing the risk of overheating or explosions. Additional market applications noted include KULR's technologies providing a means for the safe transportation and compliant disposal of potentially millions of lithium-ion batteries, putting enormous revenue in play for that service alone.\nBut that opportunity doesn't stand alone. Other value drivers include some that are out of this world, with NASA using KULR's technologies to transport and store laptop batteries on the International Space Station. KULR helps protect those billion-dollar assets with its Thermal Runaway Shield (TRS) technology that effectively prevents battery explosions by protecting against the scorching heat encountered during its deployment to space. NASA has also utilized KULR's carbon fiber thermal management technologies in the Mars Perseverance Rover and their 2017 NICER mission to mitigate the risk of excessive cooling. Earning the repeat business of NASA to protect multi-billion dollar assets is a testament to the importance and efficiency of KULR's technologies. There's more supporting the KULR value proposition.\nAcquisitions are adding immediate value.\nAccretive Acquisitions Continue\nKULR recently announced acquiring VibeTech and the subsequent launch of KULR VIBE. KULR VIBE is an AI-driven vibration reduction solution that addresses energy loss from excessive machinery vibration. Excessive vibration is a plague to modern advanced machinery that not only results in the diminished efficiency and lifespan of the asset but can also increase the risk of operator injury. Utilizing a vast database of vibration signatures, the KULR VIBE suite of technologies uses proprietary sensor processes and state-of-the-art learning algorithms to improve machinery balance and forecast component failure. Its AI learning algorithms can locate areas where excessive vibrations cause energy loss, potentially preventing performance and maintenance issues before they become dangerous.\nThis innovative VIBE technology can meet customers' demands across motorsports, aviation, transportation, renewable energy (wind), and manufacturing sectors. It also serves industrial, performance racing, and autonomous aerial (drone) applications with precise balancing solutions by successfully pinpointing areas where excess vibrations cause a loss of energy that can lead to system malfunctions, weakened performance, and maintenance issues. In other words, businesses across the global spectrum in multiple sectors need KULR products. And they are earning quite a bit.\nGlobal business behemoth Lockheed Martin just upped their order from KULR for its Phase Change Materials (PCM) heat sink technology. This carbon fiber-infused heat sink technology uses PCM to either provide or absorb heat, extending the life of crucial components used by Lockheed Martin. Validation is ongoing, but if all goes well, speculation is that the next contract with LMT could be massive.\nAnother is with Volta Energy Products, a subsidiary of Viridi Parente Inc., calling for a multi-million-dollar deployment order of KULR's Passive Propagation Resistant solution suite over three years. Notably, Volta raised $95 million to support the creation of \"fail-safe\" lithium-ion battery technology and plans to market 750 to 1,000 battery storage units in 2022 using KULR's technology. The companies note, however, that this number could increase to 50,000 units by the end of 2023. If so, KULR could score revenues of $40 million during the agreement period, and if pricing power stays constant, KULR could generate revenues as high as $80 million.\nThe combination of near-term revenue-generating opportunities isn't going unnoticed. Litchfield Hills Research analysts forecast that KULR's share price could reach $7 during 2023. Considering that more deals have been done since that bullish model provided that target, it could be conservative.\nA Compelling And Timely Investment Consideration\nMost simply stated, the KULR value proposition, even after its recent run, may be too compelling to ignore. That's not an overly bullish sentiment, either. Over the past quarters, KULR has expanded its business presence to include revenue-generating opportunities in the drone, maritime safety applications, enterprise energy storage, and crypto-mining applications sectors. More importantly, each of those needs energy storage and thermal management solutions. While any of those markets present value singularly, it's the combined potential that investors should be appraising.\nThus, the KULR value proposition is worthy of immediate attention, and whether viewed from an operational or corporate perspective, the case for investment is compelling. Its balance sheet is impressive, they are capitalizing on sales opportunities in multiple high-dollar markets, and are already selling to a global market needing best-in-industry battery safety solutions. Plus, they continue to score deals with some of the world's most prestigious agencies and companies.\nThat's a testament to how vital KULR technology can be for clients. But more than that, it supports the case that KULR may be the most perfectly positioned battery safety solutions company to target a multiple mass market need. And that should certainly put an actionable idea into investors' heads- seize the opportunity.\nDisclaimers: Shore Thing Media, LLC.

    "title": "Backed by Kygo and Murdoch, the first biodegradable water bottle is coming,  for real this time",
    "content": "Pic: Cove\nThe Cove water bottle is a thin, sturdy cylinder, eggshell-white with a matching lid. It feels familiar. “If someone gave that to you,” offered Alex Totterman, Cove’s founder and chief executive, “you probably would have no idea that that wasn’t a plastic bottle.”If someone does give you this bottle, it would be a remarkable achievement. Scientists and businesses have spent many years and much money trying to replace everyday packaging with natural materials that don’t pollute the Earth — so far, that’s given us little beyond compostable straws. But the challenge hasn’t deterred Cove from its own five-year journey to producing the first “fully biodegradable” bottle of water. In the coming months, Totterman says Cove’s creation will finally hit stores at $2.99 a pop.Totterman has also said this before. In February 2019, he told Fast Company Cove’s bottles were arriving in stores later that month. They didn’t. In October 2020, Totterman told the Los Angeles Times his bottles were arriving after the new year. Still nope. Pandemic delays and supply chain bottlenecks have repeatedly derailed the startup’s plans, as has the chemistry involved in its mission.Cove’s investors are still on board. The company has raised $20 million since 2018 from luminaries like Salesforce co-founder Marc Benioff; media heir James Murdoch; and Valor Equity Partners , an early backer of Tesla Inc. Totterman also bagged investment from the DJs Diplo and Kygo, singer Ellie Goulding and a few pop stars he wouldn’t name. By his telling, grocers, music festivals and corporate campuses are waiting with bated breath — and checkbooks in hand — for someone to produce a water bottle that people won’t feel guilty about tossing out, and Cove is nearly ready to produce 20 million bottles a year to meet interest from “pretty much every major retailer and brand,” Totterman said. ( Whole Foods is the only named customer.)Cove’s bottles start in kitchens. RWDC Industries , a chemical supplier with US headquarters in Georgia, first collects cooking oil from restaurants and ferments it into polyhydroxyalkanoates, or PHA, a polymer meant to dissolve in water or soil without any toxic residue. RWDC ships this creation to Cove’s warehouse north of Los Angeles, where it arrives as tiny round pellets that look and feel like bits of Styrofoam. RWDC — the only PHA supplier of Cove’s that the startup would name — adds secret ingredients to its concoction, but Blake Lindsey, the company’s chief commercial officer, said that there’s nothing synthetic involved.From there, the PHA pellets move to Cove’s 25,000-square-foot factory, where they are sent through machinery to vacuum away moisture, sift out metal, and stretch, cut and mold the material into a hollow canister fit for water. A label is then printed directly onto each bottle (“Cove’s plastic-free, renewable bottles”). The ink, made from algae, is meant to biodegrade, too. Water from a purification plant nearby is poured in. By Cove’s estimates, its bottles will disintegrate in water and soil in under five years.After starting in 2018, Cove cycled through at least one approach to making its bottles that didn’t pan out. When the company decided to open its own factory, in early 2021, Cove quickly discovered the unpredictability of its Goldilocks material. If PHA gets too cold, it becomes too brittle; if it’s too hot, it goes soft. During one test run, the ingredient overheated, and Cove’s factory floor erupted in steam and a pungent aroma of caramel that one early employee described as “especially vivid.” (The unique properties of PHA mean that different batches produce different scents; during a visit in early October, Cove’s factory floor smelled strongly of buttery popcorn.)Every piece of bottling equipment Cove bought also needed to be modified to handle the fickle material, and most took forever to show up. Steel pipes to transport the pellets between machines and a temperature sensor tool didn’t arrive for more than a year. Still today, one of Cove’s 12 employees manually sorts bottles rolling off the assembly line because a mechanical sorter is en route. “We ordered [it] back in January. It was promised to be here in April,” explained Cove’s vice president of technology Jim Shepherd, shouting over the machine din. “We’re now in October and basically waiting on a robot.”When Cove first started production, it would ship PHA pellets to laboratories to test their physical properties, intending to wait on the results before forging them into bottles. “It wasn’t fast enough,” said Agnes Steckler, Cove’s research director. So the company built Steckler her own lab, a room with eight machines to measure resilience, melting points and molecular weight of the PHA. The lab cost the startup more time and “millions of dollars,” Totterman said. But it was worthwhile: “We had to take a step back to take two steps forward.”Even that wasn’t the last hurdle. Once Cove finally began churning out bottles, most weren’t strong enough to withstand a tight grip, or a drop from a few feet. “It turns out, it’s very difficult to bring a new technology to market,” said Peter Rahal, an early investor.Others have tried to crack the biodegradable bottle. In 1990, the British industrial firm ICI announced a biodegradable plastic made from a mixture of bacteria and glucose that took 15 years to develop. ICI said the material absorbed enough carbon dioxide to match emissions from production, and rolled it out first as shampoo bottles in Germany. But the material was expanded to few other items and six years later ICI sold the invention patents to Monsanto, which soon pawned off the biodegradables division to a company called Metabolix. It, too, tried remaking plastics, failed, then steered the research into agriculture.Meanwhile, every food and beverage giant, under significant pressure to get off plastic, has experimented with natural substitutes. Few projects have left the lab. Last year, Coca-Cola Co . abandoned its plans for plant-based packaging in favor of 100% recyclables, arguing that consumers were demanding reusable bottles.Such corporate efforts underestimate the expense and headache of converting organic materials into a viable plastic replacement, according to Ramani Narayan, a professor at Michigan State University and expert on bioplastics. He has seen a parade of companies try harvesting various chemical mixtures, only to give up or fall short of bold promises — and he’s wary of RWDC’s claims about PHA. “Every third person comes around, ‘Oh, I’ve got this magic stuff now. I can save the world’s problems,’” Narayan said. Danimer Scientific Inc. , a company planning to make straws, Skittles bags and rum bottles using plant-based PHA, was last year accused by scientists — and short sellers — of overstating biodegradability claims. (Danimer argued its process met international testing standards.) Cove’s key ingredients from RWDC have been approved as biodegradable by certification body Tüv Austria, and Totterman says his company is awaiting similar approval for its bottle.After initially working with contractors, Totterman decided to bring Cove’s process in-house, recruiting a small team of material scientists and manufacturing veterans — though none of them are PHA experts. Before Cove, Totterman worked for a water purification startup in his native UK. Shepherd is a molecular scientist who spent decades at Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, although he hadn’t worked with PHA until joining last year. “We’re figuring out the standards,” said Totterman. “Because there isn’t a blueprint.”Investors like this temerity. “Experience can be a burden,” says Rahal, who created RxBar, the health food brand. “If you know too much and you’re too smart, you don’t jump. And you’ve got to jump.”More hurdles remain. Recent environmental legislation in California categorizes PHA as a plastic, limiting the amount of material Cove can use in production. (Ben Kogan, Cove’s policy lead, is working on a counterproposal.) And pricing is in flux. Two years ago, Cove promised a $2.29 bottle, but it has since added 70 cents to that price in response to price hikes on raw materials. Totterman thinks expecting consumers to reuse bottles or recycle more often is naïve. Expecting people to pay more for compostable bottles sounds naïve, too, but Cove sees validation in Liquid Death, an aluminum can water brand worth an eye-watering $700 million.The company also takes inspiration from another premium product: An investor deck from this summer describes Cove’s strategy as “the Tesla playbook” — sell an expensive item that conscious consumers will buy, driving down production costs. Pricey water is merely a “Trojan Horse” for a range of compostable consumer goods, Totterman said, hinting at future Cove shampoo bottles and other home care products.But first, water. Behind the Cove factory, Totterman showed off a storage warehouse stocked full of boxes with Cove’s bottles, ready to ship out when the time is right. “We kind of fought to get here, kicking and screaming this into existence,” the CEO admitted. “We’re basically in striking distance now.” He didn’t give a precise date.",

This was hinted at by The Boring Company, which recently shared an image of what appears to be a Tesla Model 3 sedan inside a “full-scale Hyperloop” test tunnel.\nElon Musk’s Hyperloop idea has been faced with skepticism since the Tesla CEO published a white paper on the concept in 2013. The fact that other companies that have pursued Hyperloop technologies are yet to roll out a mass transit system similar to Musk’s ideas has made the solution even more of a target for naysayers.\nRecent media reports have even suggested that Musk himself may be paring down on his Hyperloop ambitions. Bloomberg News, for one, recently reported that SpaceX’s Hyperloop test tunnel in Hawthorne has been torn down to make way for a parking lot. It’s a simple report, but it seemed to suggest that SpaceX was scaling back on its Hyperloop ambitions.\nThe Boring Company’s recent social media post reveals that this is not the case. In fact, the tunneling startup, which is also working on expanding its Vegas Loop tunnels in Las Vegas, appears to have made serious progress on a full-scale Hyperloop tunnel that can fit passenger vehicles. This was hinted at by the Tesla Model 3 that’s photographed inside a sealed tunnel.\nFull-scale Hyperloop Testing has begun pic.twitter.com/cDUD1PEfkD — The Boring Company (@boringcompany) November 5, 2022\nThe Hyperloop concept involves a system that operates by sending specially-designed pods through a tube that’s maintained at a partial vacuum. Musk’s concept estimated that each capsule could float on a thin layer of air similar to how pucks move on an air hockey table. Thanks to this system, the pods should be able to move at extremely high speed, with Musk estimating that a trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles should only take about 30 minutes.\nWhile it would be easy to dismiss The Boring Company’s current Hyperloop test tunnel since it is still far from Musk’s elegant, futuristic concept, it should be noted that the recently shared image is simply a test tunnel, or perhaps even the beginning of one. Thus, as The Boring Company gets more experience with its transport tunnel building thanks to projects like the Vegas Loop, the tunneling startup’s Hyperloop projects would likely become substantially closer to Musk’s vision as well.\nDon’t hesitate to contact us with news tips. Just send a message to simon@teslarati.com to give us a heads up.\nThe Boring Company announces start of full-scale Hyperloop testing",

    "content": "Lucid Air models/trims left to right: Pure, Touring, Sapphire, Grand Touring, Grand Touring Performance.\nLucid Motors will launch a less-expensive version of its Air sedan, the Air Pure, at an online event Nov. 15 prior to the Los Angeles auto show. The Air Pure starts at $89,050, with shipping.\nLucid will also mark the first delivery of the higher-trim Air Touring at the company's Beverly Hills studio, Lucid said Thursday. The Air Touring starts at $109,050, including shipping.\nThese two new trim levels represent new price territory for Lucid's first vehicle.\nThe California-based EV brand launched last year with the limited-run Dream Edition, starting at $170,500 with shipping, before debuting the Grand Touring with a starting price of $155,650. Next year, Lucid will sell the Air Sapphire, with a starting price a bit more than $250,000.\nThese less-expensive trim levels of the Air, which have been available for pre-order since last year, will allow the sedan to better compete with the Tesla Model S that starts at $106,440 with shipping and the Mercedes-Benz EQS starting at $105,550 with shipping for the base vehicle.\nRelated Article\nEV contenders differ on automated driving\n\"The online event will also feature exciting announcements about the Lucid business and future models, including the Project Gravity SUV that reimagines the luxury SUV with the same in-house-developed technology that underpins the groundbreaking Lucid Air,\" the automaker said.\nLucid offered a few details on the Pure, confirming spy shots that it will come with a metal roof rather than the panoramic glass on higher trim levels.\nThe Pure \"is distinguished by its metal roof and Mojave PurLux interior,\" Lucid said. \"Air Pure will initially launch with a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive configuration, with full specs including EPA-estimated range and additional details on the model to be shared on November 15.\"\nThe Touring will be offered with the glass roof, Lucid said.\n\"It can be optioned with the unique glass canopy — a single piece of glass that reaches from the base of the windshield to over the heads of the front passengers for an unobstructed view,\" the automaker said.\nAll five Air trim levels — Pure, Touring, Grand Touring, Grand Touring Performance and Sapphire — will be on display next week at the Beverly Hills store, Lucid said. The viewing is open to the public.\nIn addition, Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson will deliver the opening keynote at the Automotive News Congress on Nov. 18, speaking on how efficiency is critical for EV development. The Air sedan has the longest range of any EV evaluated by the EPA and is the most efficient in its segment.\nLucid also said that Derek Jenkins, senior vice president of design and brand, will be featured at Car Design Forum at the Los Angeles auto show on Nov. 17.",

    "content": "TOKYO -- Nissan's talks with alliance partner Renault are focused on optimizing their investment in electric vehicles and strengthening their competitiveness as equal partners, Makoto Uchida, the Japanese automaker's CEO, said.\nNegotiations with Renault, also Nissan's top shareholder, have less than two weeks remaining to meet a Nov. 15 target the automakers had set to reach a deal, according to people with knowledge of the talks.\nUchida declined to comment on whether an agreement could be reached this month. But he said he was talking with Renault CEO Luca de Meo every weekend and the talks would be \"ongoing for the future.\"\nThe automakers said last month they were in discussions about the future of an alliance founded in 1999 when Renault took a stake in Nissan and helped drive a turnaround for the Japanese company under former executive-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn.\nNissan is also considering investing in Renault's planned EV unit, the companies said.\nUchida said on Friday that the talks are aimed at improving the automakers' ability to compete at a time of economic uncertainty and as the industry pushes toward what he described as its biggest transformation in a century with the shift to EVs.\n\"The discussion we are having is about how to make our competitiveness even stronger,\" Uchida said. \"That is No. 1.\"\nPeople with knowledge of the talks have said the two sides have also been discussing a reduction in Renault's 43 percent stake in Nissan, potentially to 15 percent and the terms under which that could happen.\n\"We want it to be an equal partnership,\" Uchida said, adding that an \"equal partnership would make sense and that would speed up the collaboration even more.\"\nHe did not comment on potential stake levels.\nRenault is splitting off its electric vehicle business, code-named Ampere, from its legacy internal combustion engine business, code-named Horse, as it plays catch-up in the shift to electric vehicles led by U.S. rival Tesla.\nOn a separate track from its discussions with Nissan, Renault has also been talking to Geely Automobile about the Chinese automaker taking a stake in its internal combustion-engine unit, people familiar with those talks have said. That unit includes Renault production sites in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Romania and Latin America.\nThe talks with Geely, however, have caused a such riff that Nissan is willing to walk away from the deal over concerns the French automaker wants to license hundreds of jointly developed patented technologies to Geely and other players, people familiar with the negotiations said.\nWhile both sides appeared near a final agreement two weeks ago, Nissan's board and management have recently expressed concern over Renault's plans for the intellectual property, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn't public.\nIt includes some 500 joint technologies, one of the people said, among them expertise in areas such as autonomous driving, hybrid powertrains, solid-state batteries, safety systems, battery-management software and other know-how critical for developing self-driving, electrified vehicles.\nUchida said Nissan understood the transformation Renault was undertaking with the carving out of its gasoline-car business and that \"fair treatment\" for Nissan as part of a new partnership was an area of discussion. He did not mention Geely by name.\n\"If they have their new partner, A or B or C, what does that mean? We are openly discussing that,\" he said.\n\"Transparency is very important,\" he added.\nNissan sees risks in de Meo's plan to merge the French carmaker's combustion-engine operations with Geely, the people said, and are seeking assurances that key technologies will be protected under any deal with the Hangzhou-based automaker, owner of Volvo and Lotus car brands.\nUchida said he was \"surprised\" there is speculation the IP discussion may derail the wider deal, but acknowledged technology was a \"very important core asset for the alliance.\"\n\"Of course there are areas where we have to say ‘this is our core technology,' and that needs to be protected,\" Uchida said in an interview with Bloomberg News Friday. \"That's my duty as CEO.\"\nGeely didn't immediately respond to questions from Bloomberg. A representative for Renault declined to comment.\nnother sticking point is the valuation of Ampere. The lack of a specific figure backed by data is making it difficult for Nissan to determine how much to invest for a stake in the new entity, which Renault wants to list publicly, one of the people said.\nUchida declined to comment on the timing of any announcement, or on the valuation of Ampere.\nUnder Renault's plans, Ampere would be based in France and employ about 10,000 people by 2023. The entity with Geely, code-named Horse, would also have a staff of about 10,000.\n\"We have been discussing how we can make the alliance of each individual company stronger under the difficult circumstances we are facing,\" Uchida said. \"That's how it started. We also wanted to speak about how the alliance could maximize the great technology and great assets that both companies have.\"\nUchida said Nissan was making contingency plans for the prospect of a global recession. \"For us to be sustainable in the market, we need to anticipate many scenarios, and that's what we are doing,\" he said.\nHe cited the depreciation of the yen to its lowest level in decades as another concern for Nissan.\n-- Reuters and Bloomberg contributed",

Xpeng, considered to be a rival to the U.S. brand Tesla, shared designs of the full-electric vertical take-off and landing (eVToL) flying car at its fourth annual Tech Day in Guangzhou, China, on Oct. 24. The electric car, according to the company, completed a maiden flight and several tests.\n\"Driven by our vision of 'tech for the greater good' and customers' evolving demands, we continue to reach technical breakthroughs and set new industry benchmarks,\" Xpeng chairman and CEO, He Xiaopeng, said at the event.\nIn videos made available to the public, a prototype of the flying car can be seen mid-flight before landing back onto the ground. An additional teaser video of the model shows propellers, which resemble a helicopter's wings, situated on top of the car extending outward before retracting back.\nThe eVToL flying car is designed to resemble a normal car when in driving mode. The steering wheel and a right-hand gear lever are used to control it once in the air and in \"flight mode.\"\nThe flying car is just one of several breakthroughs the company shared during its Tech Day. Xpeng also shared other advancements in driver assistance technology and robotaxis.",

    "content": "MEXICO CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bright, the leading residential solar developer and financier in Mexico, announced today its entry into the commercial and industrial sector as it scales its offer to target a market representing >70% of the country's electric consumption. The company has executed its first portfolio of industrial projects with clients such as Grupo ABX, Muebles Jorman, Ladesa and Mariscal Moda Hombre, and is targeting an additional 50 MW of industrial deployments in the coming years. To capitalize the opportunity, Bright has also closed a round of growth equity from its long-time partner MGM Innova, with participation from actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, bringing the total capital raised to >$50mm USD.\nAfter clarity on the support by the federal government for distributed (rooftop) solar, hundreds of businesses have turned to the renewable alternative to alleviate or eliminate their rising commodity and electricity prices. “As a result, we’ve partnered with leading industrial solar installers to develop the most competitive and reliable solar financing product for the industry,” said Jonah Greenberger, CEO and co-founder at Bright. “Through creative financial structures, Bright now allows commercial and industrial clients to switch to solar at no upfront cost and a fixed price while generating immediate fiscal and operational savings of up to 30%.”\nBright tackles this challenge by partnering with local installers and providing the workflow automation and financing layer to enable scale and exponentially more customers.\n“I’m proud to be an early investor in Bright, a company that was a pioneer in the early days of residential solar in Latin America and today is the largest distributed solar generation company in Mexico,” said Leonardo DiCaprio.\nThrough this platform, Bright is also able to provide access to low cost development bank funding via its partnership with the Interamerican Development Bank, which was put in place as a first of a kind deal in Mexico in 2015. As a result of this collaboration, IDB expects to deploy millions in solar across LatAm in the coming years. According to the International Energy Agency, energy demand in the region is expected to increase by 50 percent by 2030 because of increased private transport and land use changes, requiring estimated global investments of up to $1.5 trillion. Bright is here to accelerate this.\nAbout Bright\nBright is Mexico’s #1 distributed generation solar provider (think Sunrun for the developing world, starting in Mexico). Bright provides a distributed solar operating system that enables thousands to offer cheaper electricity to homes at no upfront cost, working with an expansive network of project financiers, local installers, and local distributors to satisfy the resulting demand. Bright’s first market is Mexico, which has more sun, higher electricity rates, and lower labor costs than the US. Bright's investors include First Round Capital, Y Combinator, Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Servitje, the founders of Sunrun and Tesla, and other top Silicon Valley firms.\nFor more information or to see if you qualify for solar visit thinkbright.mx.",

    "title": "Nissan may ditch Renault deal over sharing technology with Geely",
    "content": "\nTOKYO -- Nissan Motor Co. is willing to walk away from a deal with Renault to re-balance their alliance amid concerns the French carmaker wants to license hundreds of jointly developed patented technologies to other players, including new Chinese partner Zheijiang Geely Holding Group, people familiar with the negotiations told Bloomberg.\nWhile both sides appeared near a final agreement two weeks ago, Nissan’s board and management have recently expressed concern over Renault’s plans for the intellectual property, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.\nIt includes some 500 joint technologies, one of the people said, among them expertise in areas such as autonomous driving, hybrid powertrains, solid-state batteries, safety systems, battery-management software and other know-how critical for developing self-driving, electrified vehicles.\nNissan sees risks in Renault CEO Luca de Meo’s plan to merge the French carmaker’s combustion-engine operations with Geely, the people said, and are seeking assurances that key technologies will be protected under any deal with the Hangzhou-based automaker, owner of Volvo and Lotus car brands.\nMakoto Uchida, Nissan’s CEO, said he was “surprised” there is speculation the IP discussion may derail the wider deal, but acknowledged technology was a “very important core asset for the alliance.”\n“Of course there are areas where we have to say ‘this is our core technology,’ and that needs to be protected,” Uchida said in an interview with Bloomberg News Friday. “That’s my duty as CEO.”\nGeely didn’t immediately respond to questions from Bloomberg. A representative for Renault declined to comment.\nUchida said Nissan's talks with Renault are focused on optimizing their investment in EVs and strengthening their competitiveness as equal partners.\nNegotiations with Renault, also Nissan's top shareholder, have less than two weeks remaining to meet a Nov. 15 target the automakers had set to reach a deal, according to people with knowledge of the talks.\nUchida declined to comment on whether an agreement could be reached this month. But he said he was talking with Renault CEO Luca de Meo every weekend and the talks would be \"ongoing for the future.\"\nThe automakers said last month they were in discussions about the future of an alliance founded in 1999 when Renault took a stake in Nissan and helped drive a turnaround for the Japanese company under former executive-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn.\nNissan is also considering investing in Renault's planned EV unit, the companies said.\nPeople with knowledge of the talks have said the two sides have also been discussing a reduction in Renault's 43 percent stake in Nissan, potentially to 15 percent and the terms under which that could happen.\n\"We want it to be an equal partnership,\" Uchida said, adding that an \"equal partnership would make sense and that would speed up the collaboration even more.\"\nHe did not comment on potential stake levels.\nRenault is splitting off its EV business, code-named Ampere, from its legacy internal combustion engine business, code-named Horse, as it plays catch-up in the shift to electric vehicles led by U.S. rival Tesla.\nOn a separate track from its discussions with Nissan, Renault has also been talking to Geely Automobile about the Chinese automaker taking a stake in its internal combustion-engine unit, people familiar with those talks have said. That unit includes Renault production sites in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Romania and Latin America.\nUchida declined to comment on the timing of any announcement, or on the valuation of Ampere.\nUnder Renault's plans, Ampere would be based in France and employ about 10,000 people by 2023. The entity with Geely would also have a staff of about 10,000.\n\"We have been discussing how we can make the alliance of each individual company stronger under the difficult circumstances we are facing,\" Uchida said. \"That's how it started. We also wanted to speak about how the alliance could maximize the great technology and great assets that both companies have.\"\nUchida said Nissan was making contingency plans for the prospect of a global recession. \"For us to be sustainable in the market, we need to anticipate many scenarios, and that's what we are doing,\" he said.\nHe cited the depreciation of the yen to its lowest level in decades as another concern for Nissan.\n-- Reuters and Bloomberg contributed",

    "content": "Inside Automotive:\nHow to build a dealership where people want to work — Carolyn Liotta\nMore women are joining the automotive industry and excelling, but it’s still not at the same rate as their counterparts in most cases. Today on Inside Automotive, we’re joined by Carolyn Liotta, Director of People and Culture at VBM Auto Group, to discuss the importance of having more women in the industry and how to recruit them. Watch the complete segment here.\nHeadlines:\nNow that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has officially closed his Twitter purchase, some employees are worried about losing their equity compensation before their stock options are vested in early November, once fired or laid off. Musk and Tesla have been sued repeatedly over claims from former employees that they were fired just before their shares were vested. Musk has already fired top Twitter executives, including the CEO, CFO, and Policy Chief. According to CNBC, Twitter managers have reassured employees that the company’s payroll department would be working to process their vested stock starting as early as November 4. Read More\nMercedes-Benz has announced pricing for its all-electric luxury sedan, the EQE, which is expected to reach US dealerships in the next few weeks. The base model EQE has a starting price of $74,900. The EQE will be available in three trim levels, premium, exclusive, and pinnacle, with three variants per trim level depending on battery size and technology options. Mercedes recently revealed an SUV version of the EQE that is expected in dealerships sometime next year. Read More\nAston Martin says it will deliver fewer vehicles than expected this year due to persistent supply chain issues. The company cut its delivery expectations from 6,600 to 6,200 cars after parts shortages prevented some 400 vehicles from being shipped during the third quarter. The automaker also reported an operating loss for the period that was higher than expected. Executive Chairman Lawrence Stroll said in a statement, “Although these headwinds, which are already improving in Q4, have disrupted our near-term financial performance and modestly impacted our full-year guidance, the medium and long-term outlook is robust.” Read More\nNews & Opinion\nHow to create more personalized marketing for your car dealership\nIdentifying, communicating, and converting high-quality prospects is the primary purpose of adding personalization to your car dealership. The personalized marketing options are similar to those of leading companies like Amazon and Netflix, which use data analytics to find the most relevant results for their users. Since they cater to a larger audience, knowing how to personalize the results can quickly boost the process. However, it can be difficult for car dealership owners to know the right way to create a car dealership. Personalized marketing ensures the use of digital technology and data analytics to create results more targeted toward individualized content to the current prospective customer base. Read More\nSmall changes in F&I questions can yield big results\nTo sell anything to anyone, regardless of the product or industry, it’s important to master one thing: asking the right questions. In the dealership environment, this is especially critical in F&I, where the entire process can be made up of equal parts anxiety and skepticism. It’s a tough place to sell for sure. F&I managers are tasked with gathering an enormous amount of information to help do their job most effectively. Trainings over the decades have focused on solid selling principles and techniques to help present features and benefits of all products on the menu but how to ask the right questions is something that morphs a bit over time.

    "content": "MENLO PARK, Calif., Nov. 2, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --  Alef Aeronautics, an advanced technology company creating alternative transportation solutions for surging traffic trends, introduced the Alef \"Model A\", the only flying car with street driving and vertical take-off. The Alef Model A flying car fits within existing urban infrastructure for driving and parking. The company plans to begin production and initiate first deliveries in Q4 of 2025.\nContinue Reading\nAlef Model A\nThe first Alef flying car is available for pre-sale to consumers now for $300K, with $150 regular queue or $1,500 priority queue deposit, on .\nThe Alef \"Model A\" flying car has a driving range of 200 miles and a flight range of 110 miles. It has a distributed electric propulsion system, no exposed propellers, extensive software flight stabilization, and safety system, elevon stabilization system, and all-wheel driving. Key safety components include triple to octuple redundancy of all key components, real-time thousand-point diagnostics, pre-flight reject start diagnostics, obstacle detection, and avoidance among others.\nThe Alef founding team of Constantine Kisly, Pavel Markin, Oleg Petrov, and Jim Dukhovny has over 70 years of experience in engineering and technology development and has been working on the Alef flying car since 2015. It earned early support from distinguished investors and industry veterans, led by Tim Draper (who, among others, was one of the first venture capitalists to invest in Tesla), former head of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Ford Aerospace Dr. Anthony Tether, NBA star Luis Scola, Bugatti designer Hirash Razaghi and others.\nAlef's CEO Jim Dukhovny says, \"The Alef Model is a modern solution for both urban and rural transportation needs in the 21st century because it is the fastest and most convenient transport ever created from the point of origin to the final destination. By enabling consumers to choose driving or flying mode, the Alef flying car allows the optimal path depending on road conditions, weather, and infrastructure.\"\n\"I accepted Tim Draper's invitation to a private demonstration of the Alef prototype vehicle in the Fall of 2021. I watched the car lift straight up like a drone, then rotate into a biplane, and immediately fly on. I felt like I was witness to a Kitty Hawk moment,\" recalled Eric Ball, Impact Venture Capital Founding General Partner.\nAlef has been test-driving and test-flying the Alef full-size prototype since 2019.\nWith additional models in development, Alef is working towards the four-person sedan, Alef \"Model Z\" scheduled for introduction in 2035 priced at $35K. It will be capable of flying 300+ miles with a driving range of 220+ miles.\nAbout Alef: Alef, based in Santa Clara, California, is a sustainable electric transportation company designing and developing a road-legal passenger car capable of achieving vertical takeoff and forward flight. Alef's goal is to enable faster, easier commutes and alleviate the burden of urban congestion through the use of proprietary technology that elevates the vehicle safely and quietly above everyday traffic.\nAbout Impact Venture Capital\nImpact Venture Capital is a Silicon Valley-based early-stage venture capital firm that invests alongside corporate venture groups and top-tier investors in early-stage technology startups with a focus on artificial intelligence applied to security, finance, digital health, and other fast-growing industry sectors.\nMedia Contact:\nPatrick Bumpus\n916-606-3711\n[email protected]\nSOURCE Impact Venture Capital",

    "title": "InfluxData Announces New Platform Enhancements at InfluxDays 2022",
    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, InfluxData, creator of the leading time series platform InfluxDB, announced significant product enhancements at InfluxDays 2022, its annual developer and community event. New features including InfluxDB Script Editor, Telegraf Custom Builder, and Flux 1.0 support developers working with time series data, allowing them to do more with less code.\nInfluxData CEO Evan Kaplan and other company leaders will kick off InfluxDays 2022 with a broadcast showcasing how InfluxDB is providing developers the ability to solve problems with time series data at a massive scale. InfluxData Founder and CTO Paul Dix will also present on the journey and roadmap of InfluxDB, with a technical deep-dive on InfluxDB IOx, the platform’s new storage engine, which delivers significant improvements in performance and usability. The keynotes begin at 8:00 a.m. PT. Watch the Day 1 and Day 2 live stream here.\n“At InfluxData, we strive to deliver as many options as possible to make the experience of building applications with time series data fast and efficient for every use case,” said Rick Spencer, Vice President of Products, InfluxData. “These new capabilities support developers at every stage of building, helping them develop applications better and faster. Time to Awesome is critical for developers – the sooner we help the developer get underway with InfluxDB, the sooner they can move onto larger problem solving within their project.”\nNew features from InfluxData accelerate application building with more capabilities and less code:\nScript Editor improves the query experience in InfluxDB Cloud with an intuitive interface and workflows so developers can uncover faster insights from their data. Script Editor delivers multi-language support and includes an integrated schema browser to contextualize data, automatic script creation, and script management for fast storage and retrieval without the need to rerun queries.\nFlux 1.0 improves collaboration, sharing, and flexibility in Flux, InfluxData’s open source data scripting language. Flux 1.0 now includes capabilities that allow users to easily share and repurpose queries so users can do more with less effort. Flux 1.0 also includes Flux Editions, which allow developers to opt-in to new Flux features without breaking changes, further ensuring stability, longevity, and granular control.\nTelegraf Custom Builder enables footprint reduction of Telegraf, InfluxData’s open source data collection agent. With a simple, low code interface, Custom Builder lets developers build a customized Telegraf binary for their needs, including lightweight and limited plug-in builds for resource-constrained edge and IoT devices.\n“Pantacor provides lifecycle management for embedded Linux devices, a segment of industry that consistently requires fast data collection with a small footprint,” said Alexander Sack, Co-Founder, Pantacor. “We’ve partnered with InfluxData to create a custom build of Telegraf that works across our embedded devices ecosystem. From WiFi routers, home appliances and robotics applications, Telegraf Custom Builder allows us to reduce Telegraf’s binary significantly, opening the door for us to derive real-time insights from nearly any IoT device.”\n“InfluxData has created the best foundation to ingest, monitor, and visualize time series data, and these new features bring the possibilities to a whole new level,” said Jorge de la Cruz, Senior Analyst, Veeam Software. “With InfluxDB, Telegraf, and Flux, InfluxData delivers an impressive level of freedom to self-develop and create an individualized and customizable experience for individual builders.”\nAll three new innovations will be featured in sessions during InfluxDays 2022, centered around the depth and breadth of the next evolution of InfluxDB: the Smart Data Platform. Technical overviews and demonstrations of the new features and capabilities will be covered during Day 1 of InfluxDays, starting today at 8:00 a.m. PT. Watch the live stream here.\nInfluxDB Script Editor and Telegraf Custom Builder are available immediately for InfluxDB users, with support for Flux 1.0 coming later this quarter. For more information on InfluxDB and the new product features, visit the InfluxData website.\nAbout InfluxData\nInfluxData is the creator of InfluxDB, the leading time series platform.

    "content": "Last week reports emerged about the launch of Ora Lighting Cat, a Porsche design-inspired EV that promises to have the performance to match its design.\nNow it has officially been launched in China with prices starting at the equivalent of less than $A41,000 after local subsidies. This model will offer a single motor with 150 kW of power and a peak torque of 340 Nm.\nThe top-of-the-range model offers a 300 kW dual-motor drivetrain which can propel the Ora Lightning Cat from 0-100 km/h in 4.3 seconds. Prices of this model are closer to $A58,000.\nThe Ora Lightning Cat will come with four battery packs supplied by Svolt Energy, a subsidiary of GWM. The battery pack sizes will include:\n63.87 kWh\n64.31 kWh\n79.62 kWh\n83.49 kWh\nThese will offer NEDC range from 555km to 705 km. Converting to WLTP cycle, expect the range to start at 450 km which is quite good for a four-door EV in 2022.\nThe new Ora Lightning Cat is longer than the Tesla Model 3 at 4,871 mm. It also offers an airy interior, just like its smaller counterpart, the Ora Good Cat. Videos of this EV have also surfaced on YouTube on channels like CARSbyML highlighting some of the exterior and interior features:\nThe Lightning Cat also comes standard with ORA-Pilot 3.0 driver-assisted systems that have an array of 28 sensors, cameras and radar. This will give buyers confidence and will meet many of the current EuroNCAP requirements to ensure it hits the 5-star safety rating.\nWith recent spottings of the Ora Good Cat testing in Melbourne and GWM Ora doing a road show in the UK during November, EVs like Ora Lightning Cat are destined for international right-hand markets.\nThe Driven’s view: We look forward to seeing new EVs that appeal to broader motorists and I can see this selling quite well in Australia further accelerating EV uptake around the nation in 2023.",

    "content": "Changpeng “CZ” Zhao offered wholehearted backing to Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover, despite the billionaire’s attempts to wriggle out of the $44 billion deal.\nThe Binance boss, who pumped $500 million into Musk’s vision for the social network, insisted he wasn’t worried by the world’s richest man trying to torpedo the investment as he was ready for either outcome.\nCZ, the founder and CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency platform, told an audience at Web Summit: “I was a little bit surprised [the deal went through].\n“But when we invest in a deal, we’re very comfortable if the deal goes through. We’re very comfortable if the deal doesn’t go through. We always want to get to a point where we’re in that position.”\nMuch faster now\nCZ also backed Musk to turbocharge a sleepy Twitter, which he claims has been slow on developing new features to attract and engage a wider user base.\n“You can see the speed of change in Twitter is much faster now,” he said.\n“Last year, I don’t know how many new features [the company rolled out]; I didn’t see that many.\n“But I fully expect that with Elon now in charge, the speed of new features rolling out will be much faster.”\nMusk has wasted no time in diving into his new acquisition, setting up weekend war rooms with his top lieutenants and recently announcing new subscription charges for users who want to be “verified” with a blue check mark.\nCZ expects this rapid acceleration to continue and warned that although 90% of ideas will likely miss the mark, he’s confident the mercurial Musk will eventually land knockout ideas.\n“Not all [new features] will stick. I would actually say probably the majority of them will not stick,” he said.\n“But that’s how you figure out the rest of the 10% of the features that will stick: by defining a lot of new features.”\nMusk, though, is seemingly not looping his main investors into his master plan, and CZ says he trusts the Tesla CEO to make the right calls.\n“Musk is a hard guy to predict,” he added.\n“I heard about the blue tick for a while, but I learned about the $8 thing at the same time you did. Anything that can reduce the bots on Twitter is fantastic.”\nROI\nPressed on when he was expecting a return on his significant investment, CZ insists he’s in for the long game and is more concerned with what Twitter offers as a “free speech” platform to the “crypto guys” and “politicians” who use it as a “global town square.”\n“We’re very long-term investors so we anticipate to be involved in the next 10 to 50 to 100 years. We’re not bothered by short term; we don’t care about that.\n“Twitter plus Elon? Independently, they have a lot of potential, but combined, there is such high potential.\n“Musk is a strong entrepreneur and we love to support him. We’re both heavy Twitter users, although he’s a bit heavier than I am.\n“Ten to 20 years from now, we’re very confident that this will be a much stronger platform than Twitter yesterday.”",
